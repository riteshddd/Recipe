Recipe Title: Beef and Plantain Casserole (Pastelón)
Recipe Summary: Here’s a Caribbean take on lasagna and possibly the most delectable casserole dish you’ve ever tasted. It’s what happens when ground beef is seasoned in sofrito (Puerto Rican marinade) and layered with sweet ripe Caribbean plantains. It’s more than a recipe, it’s a celebration of Puerto Rican and Dominican culture. I provide you with a recipe for homemade sofrito but you can shortcut with sofrito from a jar (see Tip). Serve the casserole with crusty bread and a side salad. I was introduced to pastelon by a roommate in college (Jenny) who was Puerto Rican, it was our celebratory meal. Good grades, job offers, we made pastelon!

	- 3 cups (750 mL) shredded mozzarella cheese
	- 1 cup (250 mL) shredded Parmigiano Reggiano cheese
	- Butter
	- Eggs
Recipe Methods:
	1. Sofrito: Combine garlic, capers and olives in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Gradually add green and red peppers, pimientos, culantro and cilantro, in batches, and purée until it resembles a smooth dipping salsa. Measure out 1 cup (250 mL) sofrito for the Beef Filling and store remaining in an airtight container in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. 
	2. Beef Filling: Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Cook carrot, stirring, for 5 minutes. Stir in 1 cup (250 mL) sofrito, tomato sauce, Sazón seasoning and vinegar. Add ground beef and cook, stirring often and using back of spoon to break up meat into small chunks, for 8 to 10 minutes or until browned. Add seasoned salt to taste. Remove from heat and set aside.
	3. Plantains: Place plantains on a cutting board and trim off both ends; discard ends. Slide the tip of a knife just under the edge of the peel, without cutting into the flesh, to remove peel; discard peel. Cut each plantain in half crosswise then carefully cut each half lengthwise into four ¼-inch (0.5 cm) thick slices.
	4. Heat oil over medium-high heat in another large skillet. Fry plantain slices, in batches, turning once, for about 6 minutes or until golden. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate with a slotted spoon; sprinkle with salt. Set aside.
	5. Casserole: Combine mozzarella, Parmesan and 2 tbsp (30 mL) of the parsley in a medium bowl. Brush a 13 x 9-inch (33 x 23 cm) shallow baking dish with butter. Divide the plantains into 3 portions; arrange one portion in a single layer in bottom of the dish. Spread half the beef mixture over plantains, then sprinkle with one-third of the cheese mixture. Layer with another portion of plantains, then remaining beef mixture and half the remaining cheese mixture. Arrange remaining plantains on top, pour beaten eggs over the plantains, as a binder. 
	6. Cover with foil and bake in preheated 350˚F oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, sprinkle remaining cheese over top and broil for 1 minute or until cheese is melted. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. 
	7. Meanwhile, heat tomato sauce over medium heat in a small saucepan until hot and bubbling. Serve casserole garnished with sauce and remaining parsley.
Recipe Tips:
  - *Instead of making the sofrito, you can purchase sofrito cooking base in jars, available at Latin supermarkets. Puerto Rican sofrito differs from other Hispanic countries (tomato-based sofritos), green herbaceous Puerto Rican sofritos are also sold in Latin-American stores. Making it fresh is best! **Culantro is a cousin of cilantro and has a minty flavour profile with long, narrow leaves. It is available in Asian and Latin supermarkets. ***To make Sazón -style seasoning from scratch, combine 1 tbsp (15 mL) EACH garlic powder, ground annatto seeds and ground cumin and 1 tsp (5 mL) EACH onion powder and ground turmeric in a small airtight container. With the lid on, shake well to mix. Store at room temperature for up to 6 months. Makes ⅓ cup (75 mL).

Recipe Title: Bubbe’s Pride Beef Pot Roast
Recipe Summary: This take on the traditional Beef Brisket, often served during Jewish holidays, is based on a variety of cherished family recipes. The Brisket gets slow-roasted over a bed of caramelized onions and garlic in beef broth for a luscious braise that is simple and satisfying. The onions and pan juices turn into a smooth sauce with the help of a blender, that is finished with a splash of cider vinegar. We think this recipe would make any Bubbe (Jewish grandmother) proud!

	- 3 lb (1.5 kg) Beef Brisket, Flat Portion (Pot Roast)
	- 1¼ tsp (6 mL) EACH salt and fresh ground pepper, divided
	- 3 tbsp (45 mL) vegetable oil, divided
	- 1½ lb (750 g) onions, sliced ½-inch (1 cm) thick (5 cups/1.25 L)
	- 4 cloves garlic, sliced
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) sweet paprika
	- 2 cups (500 mL) reduced-sodium beef broth
	- Cider vinegar
Recipe Shopping List:
	- Beef Brisket, Flat Portion (Pot Roast)
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper
	- Vegetable oil
	- Onions
	- 4 Cloves garlic
	- Sweet paprika
	- Reduced-sodium beef broth
	- Cider vinegar
Recipe Methods:
	1. Pat beef dry with paper towel. Season all over with 1 tsp (5 mL) each salt and pepper. Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil over medium-high heat in a Dutch oven or enamelled cast-iron roaster; brown beef, turning until browned all over. Transfer to a plate.
	2. Reduce heat to medium and add remaining oil to pot. Add onions and remaining salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, for 5 to 8 minutes or until onions start to soften and turn golden. Reduce heat to low. Cook, stirring often, for 10 to 15 minutes or until onions turn deep golden brown. Stir in garlic and paprika; cook, stirring, for 1 minute. 
	3. Return beef and any accumulated juices to pot; pour broth and 1 cup (250 mL) water over roast. Cover and cook in preheated 325°F oven for about 3 to 3½ hours or until meat is fork-tender. 
	4. Transfer roast to a cutting board, cover with foil and let rest for 15 minutes.
	5. Skim fat from pan juices; discard. Carefully transfer onions and pan juices in batches to a blender or use an immersion blender in the pot and purée until smooth. Transfer back to pot, if necessary. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Boil, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes or until sauce is thickened to desired consistency. Finish with just a splash of cider vinegar to taste.
	6. Carve roast across the grain into thin slices and serve with sauce.
Recipe Tips:
  - For added safety when blending the onions and pan juices, avoid filling the blender more than half-full, remove the vent cap from the blender’s lid and place a clean kitchen towel over top of lid before turning on the blender. This allows steam to escape and reduces the potential of hot liquid from splattering out.

	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) coarse black pepper
	- 2 tsp (10 mL) EACH salt, smoked paprika and brown sugar
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) EACH garlic powder and onion powder
	- 2½ lb (1.3 kg) Beef Porterhouse T-bone Steaks, 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick (2 steaks)

	- Wood chips 
	- Coarse black pepper
	- Salt

	- Smoked paprika
	- Garlic powder
	- Onion powder
	- 2½ lb (1.3 kg) Beef Porterhouse T-bone Steaks, 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick (2 steaks)
Recipe Methods:
	1. Soak 2 cups (500 mL) wood chips in water for at least 15 minutes or according to label instructions. 
	2. Fill drip pan part way with water and place under grill (off to one side). Preheat barbecue to medium-high (400°F/200°C). Turn off burner under drip pan. 
	3. Drain off water and place wood chips in the smoke box (if your barbecue is equipped), or wrap in a square of foil in a package and poke holes in packet to let smoke escape. Place smoker box or foil package on the grill grate above the burner that is lit for 10 to 20 minutes, or until starting to smoke. 
	4. Meanwhile, combine pepper, salt, smoked paprika, brown sugar, garlic and onion powder in a small bowl. Pat steaks dry with paper towel and rub all over with spice blend. 
	5. Place steaks on grill over the drip pan on indirect heat. Insert oven-safe meat thermometer sideways into centre of steak, avoiding fat or bone. Close lid and cook for about 10 to 12 minutes, or until the thermometer reads 120°F (49°C). 
	6. Move steaks to grill that is over the burner that is turned on. Cook for 4 to 6 minutes, turning once, or until evenly browned, and removing from grill when finished temperature reads 145°F(63°C) for medium-rare doneness at the least (or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done).
	7. Transfer steak to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. Carve meat from the bone, then across the grain into slices. 
	
Recipe Tips:
  - A smoker box is a perforated cast iron or metal box that you can use over and over. Hickory, maple or oak chips all work well in this recipe. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for wood chips, as not all varieties need to be soaked in advance. Make sure to keep the barbecue lid closed so the smoky accents from the wood chips stays in. Allow woodchips to cool completely before discarding.

	2. Discard marinade from ribs. Pat ribs dry with paper towel. Grill in a closed preheated barbecue over medium-high heat (400°F/200°C) for 8 to 10 minutes, turning twice or more or until cooked to medium-rare doneness (145°F/63°C) at the most.
	3. Meanwhile, heat sweet chili sauce in microwave-safe measuring cup in the microwave on High for about 30 seconds or in a small saucepan over medium heat. Transfer cooked ribs to a platter and brush all over the warmed chili sauce. Garnish with sesame seeds and cilantro to serve. 
Recipe Tips:
  - You can use a sealable container to marinate the ribs instead of the freezer bag. Just remember to turn the ribs or vigorously shake the container every 2 hours or so to ensure the ribs are evenly coated in the marinade.

Recipe Title: Flank Steak Grilled Cheese Sandwiches with Spicy Mayo
Recipe Summary: My mother often cooked us grilled cheese for quick dinners and I always loved it. We weren't very wealthy so we rarely had prime cuts of beef to go in our meals. I still remember that she served us canned asparagus to accompany this dish! To honour my childhood dinners, I offer you a grilled cheese that is out of the ordinary! This is a hearty sandwich but even my girlfriend who doesn’t usually each much thinks it’s perfect.

Recipe Title:  Barbecue Roast Beef with Butter Basting Sauce
Recipe Summary: The dark, full flavour of stout beer is key to the amazing basting sauce. Basting a Top Sirloin Oven Roast helps to create a juicy flavourful roast when cooked to perfection by indirect heat on the barbecue. Use a meat thermometer to cook your roast to the doneness that you like the best – without overcooking it! NOTE: ‘Time-to-cook’ figures are rough guidelines only as cook time is dependent on so many factors such as barbecue and thermometer accuracy, starting temperature of roast, roast shape and cut. A good thermometer is one of your best kitchen investments.

	- Butter
	- Packed brown sugar
	- Apple cider vinegar
	- Worcestershire sauce
	- Hot pepper sauce
	- 1 onion
	- 4 sprigs fresh thyme 
	- 4 cloves garlic
	- 2 lb (1 kg) Beef Top Sirloin Oven Roast 
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper
Recipe Methods:
	1. Combine beer, butter, sugar, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, onion, thyme and garlic in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally; reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, cover and let stand for 10 minutes. Strain into a bowl; discard onion, thyme and garlic. 
	2. Meanwhile, fill drip pan with water and place under grill (off to one side). Preheat barbecue to medium-high (400°F/200°C).
	3. Pat roast dry with paper towel. Rub all over with salt and pepper. Insert oven-safe meat thermometer into centre of roast. Place roast on grill over drip pan; turn off burner under drip pan. Close lid and cook, basting with butter-beer sauce every 15 minutes, for about 50 to 65 minutes for medium-rare, removing from grill when 5°F (3°C) below desired finished temperature (145°F/63°C for medium-rare, or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done). 
	 4. Transfer roast to cutting board, cover with foil and let rest for 15 minutes. 
	 5. Reheat remaining butter-beer sauce in small saucepan over medium-high heat until boiling; remove from heat and cover to keep warm. 
	 6. Carve roast across the grain into thin slices and arrange on a platter. Serve with some of the warm sauce spooned over the slices of meat and pass the remaining warm sauce at the table. 
Recipe Tips:
  - Opening the lid to baste the roast will release a lot of the heat in the grill, so be sure to work quickly when brushing the sauce over the roast and close the lid as soon as possible to maintain the internal temperature of the barbecue.

Recipe Methods:
	1. Hummus: Combine garlic, lemon juice, and 1 tsp (5 mL) salt in a food processor until coarsely puréed; let stand for 10 minutes to allow garlic to mellow.
	2. Strain garlic mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl, pressing on solids to release as much liquid as possible; discard solids. Return liquid to food processor. 
	3. Add tahini and pulse to combine. With motor running, add about ¼ cup (60 mL) ice water, one tablespoon (15 mL) at a time, and process until mixture is very smooth, pale, and thick (it may seize up at firs but will loosen as more water is added). Add chickpeas and cumin; purée for several minutes, until the hummus is smooth and uber-creamy. Then purée it some more until fluffy. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt, lemon juice and cumin as desired. Set aside.

	5. Steak: Place steak on cutting board with grain running vertically. Starting at one side (with the knife parallel to the grain), cut horizontally in half almost, but not all the way through, leaving about ½ inch (1 cm) at opposite edge attached, to butterfly. Pat steak dry with paper towel. Season all over with salt and pepper.
	6. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Sear steak for about 5 minutes, turning twice or more, or until a digital instant-read thermometer inserted sideways into steak reads 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare doneness at the least. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for at least 5 minutes or until cool.
	7. To serve: Cut steak into ½-inch (1 cm) cubes. Spoon ¾ cup (175 mL) of Hummus in the middle of a small platter or large plate. Make a large well with the back of a spoon, almost all the way, but not quite to the rim of the platter or plate. Drizzled with olive oil and sprinkle with smoked paprika. Sprinkle steak in around and on the hummus. Drizzle generously with Salsa Verde and serve with bread or pita.
Recipe Tips:
  - Chef Rose recommends an excellent quality tahini for the best hummus. His personal preference is Soom Foods brand. Extra hummus can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

	- Red cabbage
	- 2 carrots
	- 1 apple
	- Beef broth
	- Red wine or apple juice

	- 2 whole cloves
	- 4 sprigs fresh rosemary (or 2 tsp/10 mL crumbled dried rosemary)
Recipe Methods:
	1. Pat roast dry with paper towel and rub all over with salt and pepper to your taste. 
	2. Heat a lightly oiled Dutch oven or enamelled cast-iron roaster over medium-high heat; brown roast, turning with tongs, for about 10 minutes until browned all over. Add leeks, potatoes, cabbage, carrots, apple, beef broth, red wine, bay leaf, peppercorns, cloves and rosemary. Bring to just a boil.
	3. Reduce heat, cover and simmer on stove-top or in preheated 325°F oven for about 3 hours or until beef is fork-tender. (Note: oven is best for maintaining a simmer.)
	4. Transfer roast to cutting board, cover with foil and let rest for 15 minutes. Remove cloves, bay leaf and rosemary stems from sauce. Slice roast across the grain into thin slices and serve with the braised vegetables and sauce.
Recipe Tips:
  - Browning Pot Roast before cooking helps to develop beef flavour but, if pressed for time, you can skip this step without too much sacrifice.

Recipe Title: Oven Roast Beef with Au Jus
Recipe Summary: Au Jus is just a fancy name for making a beef gravy without adding any flour or cornstarch for thickening. Our time-test results are based on a roast that was about 7-in (17.5 cm) long x 5-in (12.5 cm) wide x 4-in (10 cm) deep. NOTE: ‘Time-to-cook’ figures are rough guidelines only as cook time is dependent on so many factors such as: oven and thermometer accuracy, starting temperature of roast, roast shape and cut. A good thermometer is one of your best kitchen investments.

	- Salt
	- 1 shallot
	- Sherry vinegar or wine vinegar
	- Extra virgin olive oil
	- 8 oz (250 g) watercress or baby arugula (about 2 packages)
	- Red onion
	- 1 ripe pear
	- Crumbled goat cheese
Recipe Methods:
	1. Garlic Croutons: Use Furlani Garlic Bread to make homemade croutons for this and many more summer salads. Preheat barbecue to medium-high heat (400˚F/200˚C). Cut Furlani Garlic Bread into ½-inch (1 cm) cubes. Arrange bread cubes, in an even layer, in a large foil pan. Place pan off to one side of barbecue and turn off the burners directly under the pan. Cook in closed barbecue, tossing occasionally, for 20 to 25 minutes or until croutons are golden brown and crispy all the way through. Let cool. Set aside 1 cup (250 mL) for this Pear and Grilled Steak Salad. (Let the remaining croutons cool for 2 to 4 hours before transferring to an airtight container to store for up to 1 week.) 
	2. Pat the Canadian Beef Flank Steak dry with paper towel. Sprinkle with ½ tsp (2 mL) of the salt and all the pepper. Barbecue over medium-high heat, turning a least twice with tongs, to your desired level of doneness. The temperature for medium-rare is 145°F (63°C), 160°F (71°C) for medium, and 170°F (77°C) for well-done. Place steak on a cutting board; let stand 5 minutes. 
	3. Meanwhile, combine shallot, vinegar, oil and salt in a mini chopper; pulse until mixture is almost smooth. Set aside.
	 4. Pour half of the dressing over watercress in a large bowl; toss to coat. Arrange on serving plates; top each serving with onion and pear. Carve steak across the grain into thin slices. Top each serving with sliced steak, 1 cup (250 mL) reserved *croutons and goat cheese; drizzle each with remaining dressing.

Recipe Title: Persian Beef Kabobs Marinated with Pomegranate, Molasses and Walnut (Torsh Kabob)
Recipe Summary: Kabobs take pride of place among other meat dishes in Persian cuisine. There are many different kabob recipes from all over Iran and, of course, the middle east! Kabob is more of a family meal in Iran. It’s a dish that definitely gets served on special occasions, but more than that, kabob is a picnic food! Making kabob for picnics is something that every kid in Iran grows up with. My childhood memories are tied to the weekends that my mom was marinating kabob the night before the picnic and my dad cooking kabobs over charcoal grill in the park. Torsh kabob originates in the north of Iran. There is an herb for marinating this kabob and it’s specifically just grown in northern Iran called Chochagh. As I’m trying to adopt the recipes to where I live, I’m using other aromatic herbs instead. Kabobs are best cooked on a charcoal grill to get the smoky flavor but a gas barbecue is also fine. However, if you crave for kabob in winter and you live in a city with brutal winters, then a cast-iron pan is the best choice. Two best things to serve with kabob are lavash bread and/or saffron rice. There are many side dishes which go very well with kabob such as Mast-o Moosir (yogurt and Persian shallot dip), Torshi (pickled vegetables), Shirazi salad or fresh herbs.

Recipe Title: Pan-Seared Skirt Steak with Mushrooms and Spaetzle  
Recipe Summary: This recipe highlights two things for me: first is the spaetzle simmered in a mushroomy, buttery, brothy reduction, taught to me by my first chef, the Alsatian Olivier Muller — what a delicious combination. Second is the incredible flavour and texture you can find in Canadian Beef, especially using outside skirt steak — one of my favourite cuts. Outside skirt steak is thicker than inside skirt. It’s technically a tougher cut, but when sliced across the grain it becomes more tender and it is ideal for one-pot dishes like this one or a stir-fry. Alternatively, you could use blade steak or shoulder-end rib eye which are also very flavourful, tougher cuts. This recipe was adapted from Chef Heinrich’s original and modified to cook at home.

	- ⅓ cup (75 mL) concentrated beef broth (see Tip*)
	- 1⅓ oz (40 g) trimmed kale, cut into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces
	- 14 oz (400 g) cooked spaetzle (see Tip**) 
	- Chopped fresh chives
	- White truffle oil
Recipe Shopping List:
	- Garlic
	- Fresh rosemary
	- Fresh thyme
	- 2½ oz (75 g) cremini mushrooms
	- 2½ oz (75 g) shiitake mushrooms
	- 1 small shallot
	- Kale
	- Fresh chives
	- 7 oz (210 g) Beef Outside Skirt Marinating Steak

	- Concentrated beef broth (see Tip*)
	- Salt 
	- Pepper
	- Cooked spaetzle or dry broad German egg noodles (see Tip**)
	- Unsalted butter
	- Dry white wine
Recipe Methods:
	1. Cut steak across the grain into pieces about 3 inches (7.5 cm) long and ½ inch (1 cm) thick. Pat dry with paper towel and season all over with salt and pepper to your taste. Set aside.
	2. Heat a large sauté pan or deep skillet over high heat; add oil and swirl to cook. Add steak pieces, cut side down. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook steak until well caramelized on the bottom. Flip over and add 2 cubes of the butter, the garlic, rosemary and thyme. Cook, continuously spooning the butter over beef, until beef is cooked to desired doneness. Transfer beef, herbs and garlic to a plate using tongs and leaving butter in pan; set aside.
	3. Return pan to high heat. Add cremini and shiitake mushrooms; cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes or until golden. Reduce heat to medium and add shallots. Cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Pour in wine and boil, scraping up brown bits stuck to pan, until liquid is almost evaporated. Pour in beef broth, ¾ cup (175 mL) water and kale; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat and simmer for 2 minutes.
	4. Meanwhile, strip rosemary and thyme leaves from stems; discard stems. Finely chop herbs and garlic; add to pan along with any accumulated juices from beef. Stir in spaetzle and remaining butter cubes; cook, stirring gently, until butter is melted. Adjust sauce consistency as desired by simmering to reduce or adding more water to thin. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
	5. Spoon spaetzle, mushrooms and sauce into serving bowls, top with beef and garnish with chives and a light drizzle of truffle oil.
Recipe Tips:
  - *The concentrated broth is convenient alternative to Chef Heinrich’s homemade beef jus and is available in cartons in the soup aisle at the grocery store. If you don’t have concentrated broth, use 1 cup (250 mL) no-salt-added beef broth and reduce water to ¼ cup (60 mL) in step 3.
  - **Prepare your favourite spaetzle recipe to use for serving, or substitute about 7 oz (210 g) dry broad German egg noodles; cook according to package directions before serving.

	- 3 small white potatoes
	- 1 large onion
	- Garlic
	- 8 oz (250 g) cherry tomatoes on the vine (optional)
	- 1 lb (500 g) Lean Ground Beef
	- Olive oil, divided
	- Salt
	- Pepper
	- Ground turmeric 
	- Yellow split peas
	- Tomato paste
Recipe Methods:
	1. Fill a medium saucepan half-full with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Add split peas, reduce heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes or until tender. Drain and set aside to cool completely.
	2. Meanwhile, fill a medium bowl half-full with cold water. Peel potatoes and cut into ½-inch (1 cm) cubes. Add to water and set aside for at least 15 minutes to release the starch from potatoes.
	3. Cut onion in half. Finely dice one half and coarsely chop the other half. Set aside separately.
	4. Combine split peas, coarsely chopped onions, garlic, salt, pepper and turmeric in a food processor. Blend well for 1 to 2 minutes or until smooth. Scrape into a large bowl.
	5. Add ground beef to the split pea mixture and use your hands to mix everything together for 1 to 2 minutes, ensuring it is well mixed. Scoop beef mixture into 1½-inch (4 cm) meatballs, rolling between hands to make sure they are round.
	6. Heat 1½ tsp (7 mL) of the oil over medium-high heat in a heavy enamelled cast-iron pan or deep nonstick skillet. Fry meatballs, in batches, turning until golden brown all over. Transfer to a bowl.
	7. Add diced onions to pan and cook, stirring, for about 3 minutes or until translucent. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute. Return meatballs and accumulated juices to the pot. Add about 2 to 3 cups (500 to 750 mL) boiling water to fill the pot enough to come halfway up the meatballs. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes or until the sauce is thick and a digital instant-read thermometer inserted into several meatballs reads 160°F (71°C).
	8. Meanwhile, drain potatoes and pat dry with a paper towel. Add 3 tbsp (45 mL) oil to another heavy saucepan or skillet. Add potatoes and fry over medium-low heat, stirring often, for about 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown and tender. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
	9. If garnishing with the vine tomatoes, return the pan to medium heat. Add remaining 1½ tsp (7 mL) oil to the pan. Cook tomatoes, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes or until blistered and slightly softened. Remove from heat.
	10. Spoon potatoes and meatballs onto a platter or serving plate. Drizzle meatballs with tomato sauce and garnish the platter with the blistered tomatoes (if using).

Recipe Title: Barbecue-Roasted Steak with Tuscan-Inspired Rub
Recipe Summary: Flavoured with rosemary, garlic and good-quality olive oil, this simple Tuscan-style grilled steak is inspired by the classic Florentine recipe.

	- 1 tsp (5 mL) EACH salt and fresh ground pepper
	- 1 clove garlic, minced 
	- Post-sear Rub
	- ¼ cup (60 mL) finely chopped fresh parsley
	- 3 tbsp (45 mL) good-quality extra virgin olive oil
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) grated lemon zest
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) fresh lemon juice
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) anchovy paste
	- 2 cloves garlic, minced
	- ¼ tsp (1 mL) hot pepper flakes 
	- Coarse salt and cracked pepper
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1  Beef Frenched Rib Steak, 1-bone thick (about 3 lb/1.5 kg)
	- Vegetable oil
	- Fresh rosemary
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper
	- 1 clove garlic
	- Fresh parsley
	- Good-quality extra virgin olive oil
	- Lemon
	- Anchovy paste
	- 2 cloves garlic
	- Hot pepper flakes
	- Coarse salt and cracked pepper
Recipe Methods:
	1. Fill drip pan part way with water and place under grill (off to one side). Preheat barbecue to medium-high (400°F/200°C). 
	2. Meanwhile, pat teak dry with paper towel. Combine oil, rosemary, salt, pepper and garlic in a small bowl. Rub mixture all over steak. 
	3. Place steak on grill over drip pan; turn off burner under drip pan. Insert an oven-safe meat thermometer sideways into centre of steak, avoiding fat or bone. Close lid and cook for about 40 to 50 minutes, or until the thermometer reads 120°F (49°C).
	4. Post-sear Rub: Meanwhile, combine parsley, oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, anchovy paste, garlic and hot pepper flakes in a small bowl. Drizzle half over a large cutting board; set board and remaining oil mixture aside.
	 5. Move steak to grill that is over the burner that is turned on. Cook for 8 to 12 minutes, turning once, for medium-rare until evenly browned on both sides, removing from grill when 5°F (3°C) below desired finished temperature (145°F/63°C for medium-rare, or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done).
	 6. Transfer steak to reserved cutting board, turning twice or more to coat with herb mixture. Cover loosely with foil and let rest for 15 minutes.
	 7. Carve meat from the bone, then into thin slices. Arrange steak on a large platter with the bone. Drizzle remaining herb mixture over sliced steak. Sprinkle with coarse salt and cracked pepper.
Recipe Tips:
  - Wrap the bone in foil prior to grilling for a cleaner presentation if desired. A Frenched Rib Steak is similar to a Tomahawk-style Steak that is cut 1-bone thick with an exposed bone. For the Frenched Rib Steak, the bone is cleaned or “Frenched” and about 4 inches (10 cm) long.

	- Salt and pepper
	- Extra virgin olive oil

	- Dried oregano leaves
	- Black olives, preferably sun-dried, pitted
	- 1 pkg (500 g) gnocchi
	- Freshly grated Parmesan  
Recipe Methods:
	1. Place steaks on a cutting board in a single layer. Pierce the steaks all over with a fork. Cut crosswise into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces and toss with salt and pepper. 
	2. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Cook beef strips for about 1 minute per side or until browned but still pink inside. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
	3. Return skillet to medium-high heat and add butter. Add mushrooms, onion and garlic; cook, stirring, for 8 minutes or until mushrooms start to brown. Reduce heat to medium.
	4. Cut tomatoes in the can with scissors or crush with your hand one by one while adding to skillet; pour in juices from the can. Add wine and oregano; bring to a simmer. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes or until starting to thicken. Return beef and accumulated juices to skillet; stir in olives. Simmer for about 5 minutes or until heated through.
	5. Meanwhile, cook gnocchi in a pot of boiling salted water for about 5 minutes or according to package directions, until al dente. 
	6. Lift gnocchi out with small sieve or slotted spoon and add to sauce. Toss to coat. Serve sprinkled with Parmesan, if desired. 
Recipe Tips:
  - You can substitute any fast-fry steaks for the Sirloin Tip. If they are thicker than ¼ inch (5 mm) you can pound them with a meat mallet before piercing them with the fork. You can use shelf-stable, fresh or frozen gnocchi for this recipe. Do check the package directions for the recommended cooking time. This sauce is usually made as a slow simmer to help tenderize beef cuts which can lengthen dinner preparation time; by using these quick fast-fry steaks you get the fresh flavour of the tomato sauce and tender beef that comes together in under an hour.

	- Whipping cream
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) cornstarch mixed with 1 tsp (5 mL) cold water (optional)
	- Salt and pepper
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 2½ lb (1.25 kg) Beef Tenderloin Premium Oven Roast, centre-cut, trimmed, about 4-inches (10 cm) in diameter
	- Olive oil
	- Coarsely ground salt and pepper
	- Butter
	- Vegetable oil
	- 2 shallots
	- 1 green onion
	- 2 cups (500 mL) finely chopped mushrooms
	- 2½ oz (75 g) chicken or duck liver pâté

	- All-purpose flour
	- 1 egg
	- Beef broth
	- Madeira
	- Whipping cream
	- Cornstarch (optional)
	- Salt and pepper
Recipe Methods:
	1. If roast is tied, remove twine. Rub all over with olive oil and season with salt and pepper to your taste. Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) of the butter with the vegetable oil over medium-high heat in heavy skillet; brown meat for about 8 minutes, turning to brown on all sides. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
	2. Melt remaining butter in same skillet. Add shallots and onion; cook, stirring, for about 1 minute or until softened. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 to 10 minutes or until liquid has evaporated and mushrooms start to brown. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer mushroom mixture to a bowl and set pan aside to use for Madeira Mushroom Sauce.
	3. Pat reserved tenderloin dry with paper towel; top with pâté slices and mushroom mixture, pressing mixture onto tenderloin to hold. Set aside. Line rimmed baking sheet with foil or parchment paper; spray lightly with non-stick spray. Set aside.
	4. Roll out the puff pastry dough on lightly floured surface (if your pastry is a block, place the smooth side up before you roll), into a 13 x 12-inch (32 x 30 cm) rectangle, rolling over the seam to hold the 2 squares together. Place over tenderloin and tuck dough around the sides and ends. Gently turn over, wrapping dough around underside and ends of tenderloin to fully enclose; brush some beaten egg along edges of seams where dough overlaps, pressing gently to seal.
	5. Place Beef Wellington seam side down onto baking sheet. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes or up to 1 hour. (If refrigerated 1 hour, let the Wellington sit at room temperature 30 minutes before baking.)
	 6. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) oven. (NOTE: The Beef Wellington is roasted on the lowest rack of a very hot oven to help create a crispy crust.) Cut 3 slits across the top of pastry to allow steam to escape while baking; brush all over with beaten egg.
	 7. Bake Wellington until golden brown (shielding with loose cover of aluminum foil if getting to brown), and digital instant-read thermometer inserted into centre of roast reads 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare doneness, about 35 minutes.
	8. Madeira Mushroom Sauce: Meanwhile, place reserved skillet over medium-high heat; add beef broth and bring to a boil, stirring up brown bits from bottom of pan. Boil for 15 to 20 minutes to reduce to about 1⅔ cups (400 mL). Stir in Madeira and continue to boil for about 5 minutes or until liquid is reduced again to 1⅔ cups (400 mL). Stir in a generous splash of whipping cream to taste. If desired, thicken sauce by stirring in cornstarch mixture; cook, stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes until slightly thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour onto gravy boat to serve.
	9. Remove Beef Wellington from oven and let rest for 10 minutes; transfer to carving platter. Carve into thick slices and serve with Madeira Mushroom Sauce.
Recipe Tips:
  - If you buy puff pastry in pre-rolled sheets, stack the 2 sheets and pinch around edges to squeeze the sheets together making sure there are no air bubble between the sheets. Roll out to the rectangle as directed in the recipe. The package sizes may range between 397 g and 500 g and any of these will work for this recipe.

Add beef with marinate and cook, without stirring, for 30 seconds to char slightly. Stir-fry for 1 minute or until cooked to medium-rare. Transfer to a clean bowl and set aside.
	5. Add remaining oil to wok with onion and stir-fry for 30 to 60 seconds or until wilted. Add carrots, baby bok choy, oyster mushrooms and ¼ cup (60 mL) water. Cover and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until vegetables are slightly softened.
	6. Pour over cooked beef, stirring to coat. Add beef mixture to wok, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring often, for 1 to 2 minutes or until sauce is thickened. Garnish with green onions.
	7. Spoon the Stir-fry into the middle of the Noodles, leaving a border around the edges for the noodles to remain crispy. Serve immediately.
Recipe Tips:
  - Fresh chow mein noodles are highly recommended; they’re found in the refrigerator section of the Asian grocery store and well-stocked supermarkets. You may also substitute with dry chow mein noodles. Cook according to the package until al dente, drain well and let cool. Pat dry before you fry them.

Recipe Ingredients List:
	- 1 lb (500 g) Beef Sausages (about 4)
	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) EACH butter and olive oil 
	- 1 large onion, halved and thinly sliced 
	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) balsamic vinegar
	- Salt and pepper
	- 4 sausage buns
	- 1 tomato, seeded and cut into chunks
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1 lb (500 g)  Beef Sausages  (about 4)
	- Butter
	- Olive oil
	- 1 large onion
	- Balsamic vinegar
	- Salt and pepper
	- 4 sausage buns
	- 1 tomato, seeded
Recipe Methods:
	1. Melt butter and olive oil over medium heat in medium saucepan; heat until butter is melted. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes or until very soft and caramelized (reduce heat as necessary to prevent burning). Stir in balsamic vinegar and season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.
	2. Meanwhile, grill the sausages on a lightly oiled grill in a closed preheated barbecue over medium-high heat (400°F/200°C) for 10 to 14 minutes, turning often, or until a digital instant-read thermometer inserted lengthwise into centre of each sausage reads 160°F (71°C). Transfer to a plate and keep warm. Toast the buns lightly, split side down on the grill. 
	3. Assemble sausages into toasted buns and top with the Caramelized Onions and chunks of tomato to serve.
Recipe Tips:
  - Use a digital instant-read thermometer to best judge if sausage is done. Cutting sausages open to check for doneness reduces the juiciness of sausages and is not a true way to test doneness.

	7. Divide salad among serving plates and top with lollipops.
Recipe Tips:
  - If you would rather just serve slivers of cooked steak with the salad, you can skip making the lollipops and cook steak whole, carving it across the grain to serve. Grill as directed in step 5 for 6 to 8 minutes for ½ inch (1 cm) thick steak.

Recipe Title: Chimichurri Pan-Fried Beef Liver Sandwiches with Tangy Slaw
Recipe Summary: Similar to pesto, chimichurri is an Argentinian herb condiment, often served with beef. It’s made with fresh cilantro and parsley, vinegar and a touch of heat and in this recipe, the chimichurri is used to marinate strips of beef liver, dress the coleslaw and stirred into mayo for a creamy sauce. The tartness of the vinegar and freshness of the herbs are the perfect complement to the rich beef liver. Take care to not overcook liver.

	- 1 lb (500 g) sliced Beef Liver, about ¼ inch (5 mm) thick
	- ½ cup (125 mL) light mayonnaise 
	- 4 cups (1 L) shredded coleslaw blend 
	- 6 soft buns, such as brioche, Kaiser or ciabatta, split and toasted
Recipe Shopping List:
	- Red wine vinegar
	- 3 cloves garlic
	- 1 large shallot
	- Salt
	- Fresh ground pepper

	- Light mayonnaise
	- 4 cups (1 L) shredded coleslaw blend 
	- 6 soft buns, such as brioche, Kaiser or ciabatta
Recipe Methods:
	1. Stir vinegar with garlic, shallot, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Let stand for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, cut liver slices into ½-inch (1 cm) wide strips (similar to steak stir-fry strips). Stir cilantro, parsley, oregano and hot pepper flakes into vinegar mixture. Whisk in olive oil. Pour ½ cup (125 mL) of the chimichurri over liver strips in another bowl, stirring to coat; cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
	2. Stir 2 tbsp (30 mL) chimichurri into mayo in a small bowl; set aside. Add remaining chimichurri to coleslaw blend in large bowl; toss until well coated. Cover and refrigerate both mayo mixture and coleslaw until ready to serve. (Make-ahead: keep refrigerated in a covered container for up to 1 day.) 
	3. Heat a cast-iron skillet or other heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Pat liver dry with paper towel, reserving any marinade in bowl. Pan-fry liver strips, in batches, for 2 to 3 minutes per side or until evenly browned on the outside and still slightly pink on the inside and springy to the touch. Transfer liver to a clean platter as it’s cooked. Add reserved marinade to pan and bring just to a simmer. (Liver is best when cooked to medium doneness, at most.) 
	4. Spread chimichurri mayo on bottom half of each bun. Top with cooked liver and coleslaw. Sandwich with top half of bun. 
Recipe Tips:
  - One of the reasons some people don’t like liver is because it has been overcooked. Liver can be served slightly pink. Overcooked liver develops a mealy texture. When thinly sliced, liver just needs a quick sear, followed by a minute of reheating in the sauce.

	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) extra virgin olive oil
	- Coarse salt and fresh ground pepper
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) vegetable oil
	- 2 shallots, minced
	- 1 cup (250 mL) dry red wine
	- 2 tsp (10 mL) Dijon mustard
	- 1½ cups (375 mL) no-salt-added beef broth
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 3 cloves garlic
	- Fresh parsley leaves
	- Basil leaves
	- Fresh rosemary leaves
	- Dijon mustard
	- Pecans
	- Extra virgin olive oil
	- Freshly grated Parmesan cheese
	- Coarse salt and fresh ground pepper
	- 3½ lb (1.75 kg) Beef Tenderloin Premium Oven Roast, centre-cut
	- Vegetable oil
	- 2 shallots
	- Dry red wine
	- No-salt-added beef broth
Recipe Methods:
	1. Mixed Herb Pesto: Mince garlic in food processor; add parsley, basil, rosemary, Dijon and pecans; pulse until minced. With processor running, gradually add oil, processing for about 3 minutes or until incorporated and smooth. Transfer to bowl and stir in cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste; set aside.
	2. Beef: Using a carving knife, slice roast lengthwise stopping when you are about ½ inch (1 cm) from bottom of the roast. Open the roast up like a book and cut one side to ‘unroll’ the roast to be about ½-inch (1 cm) thick. Repeat with the other side so that you end up with a rectangular piece of meat that is about ½-inch (1 cm) thick.
	 3. Spread ¾ cup (175 mL) pesto over the beef (reserving the remaining pesto for another use). Starting at the long side, roll roast up jelly-roll style. Tie with kitchen twine, at about 2-inch (5 cm) intervals. Rub all over with 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil and season lightly with salt and pepper.
	4. Place roast on a rack in shallow pan. Insert oven-safe thermometer into centre of roast. Oven-sear in preheated 450°F oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 275°F; roast for about 40 minutes for medium-rare, removing from oven when 5°F (3°C) below desired finished temperature (145°F/63°C for medium-rare, or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done). Transfer roast to cutting board, cover with foil and let rest for 15 minutes.
	5. Sauce: Meanwhile, add oil to roasting pan and heat over medium-high heat. Add shallots and cook, stirring, for about 4 minutes or until shallots are softened. Add red wine and bring to a boil; boil for about 4 minutes or until almost completely evaporated. Stir in Dijon and beef broth; bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits from pan. Boil, stirring often for about 10 minutes or until thickened and reduced to about 1 cup. Season with salt and pepper to taste. 
	6. Carve roast across the grain into thick slices and serve with sauce.
Recipe Tips:
  - Refrigerate extra pesto in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Here are a few ideas for using any extra pesto mixture. Mix with mayonnaise for a quick sandwich spread. Toss with cooked pasta for a quick dinner idea with leftover meat, cheese and thinly sliced roasted red peppers or use on pizza dough instead of a red sauce and top with goat cheese and salami pieces.

Recipe Title: Barbecued Dill-Marinated Roast Beef Sandwiches
Recipe Summary: Don’t let anything go to waste with this unique recipe idea!

	- Tapioca starch
Recipe Methods:
	1. Beef: Combine ground beef, sugar, oyster sauce, chicken bouillon, cornstarch, sesame oil, white pepper, green onion, and salt. &nbsp;Add baking soda and ¼ cup (60 mL) water. Mix thoroughly for 5 minutes by hand or with a stand mixer using the paddle attachment on medium speed until thoroughly combined. Set aside.
	2. Rice Roll (Cheung Fun): Whisk together rice flour, tapioca starch, 2 cups (500 mL) water and salt in a bowl until well blended and smooth. Set aside.
	3. Sauce: Combine soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, ginger, and green onions and 1 cup (250 mL) water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Strain through a sieve, discarding solids. Set sauce aside and let cool.
	4. To cook rice rolls, bring 2 cups (500 mL) of water to a boil in a large steamer or wok (or enough to fill steamer with 1 to 2 inches/2.5 to 5 cm water). Place a shallow trivet on the bottom of steamer and place an 8-inch (20 cm) square nonstick baking pan on trivet. Cover steamer with a tight-fitting lid. Steam for 2 minutes to ensure the pan is hot enough to prevent the rice roll (Cheung Fun) batter from sticking to the bottom.

Remove the lid and spoon 3 heaping tablespoons (45 mL) of the beef mixture, about 2 inches (5 cm) from the left side of the pan in a vertical line on top of the rice roll. Cover and steam for 3 minutes or until beef is thoroughly cooked (see Tip). Carefully remove pan from steamer and let cool for 1 minute. 
	6. Using a scraper or rubber spatula, working from the edge closest to the meat, carefully fold the edge of the rice roll over the meat and continue to roll up the rice roll, to enclose the meat and form a cylindrical shaped roll. Carefully transfer the rolled rice roll onto a serving plate and top with 3 tablespoons (45 mL) of the Sauce and garnish with green onion. Repeat with remaining rice roll batter and beef mixture to make 5 additional rolls. Serve hot as soon as possible.
Recipe Tips:
  - To ensure the ground beef is thoroughly cooked, insert a digital instant-read thermometer lengthwise into beef mixture to ensure the internal temperature reaches 160°F (71°C). If beef is not cooked, cover and steam a few minutes longer.

	- 8 baby bok choy
	- 2 green onions
Recipe Methods:
	1. Combine soy sauce, honey, sriracha and cornstarch in a small bowl; set sauce aside.
	2. Heat oil over medium-high heat in large wok or nonstick skillet. Add beef strips, garlic and gingerroot; stir-fry for 2 minutes or until meat is cooked to medium (160ºF/71ºF) and browned but still pink inside. Transfer to a clean bowl; tent with foil to keep warm.
	3. Add carrot, red pepper, baby corn and bok choy to skillet; stir-fry for 3 to 5 minutes or until almost tender-crisp. Return beef with any accumulated juices to skillet, along with the reserved sauce; bring to a boil. Cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes or until sauce is bubbly and thickened, beef is heated through and vegetables are just tender. Remove from heat; stir in green onions.  
Recipe Tips:
  - Save prep time by using 4 cups (1 L) Asian-blend frozen vegetables in place of the carrot, sweet pepper, corn and bok choy, and use tubes or jars of puréed garlic and gingerroot, found in the produce section.

Recipe Title: Sous Vide Eye of Round Roast
Recipe Summary: This lean oven roast benefits amazingly from the low-and-slow cooking method of sous vide. The preset temperature of the water bath determines the internal doneness temperature of your roast so you know it will cook perfectly and evenly all the way through. The natural beef juices are sealed in keeping the roast flavourful, tender and juicy. It’s just the thing to serve hot or cold, thinly sliced and piled on sandwiches, topped with caramelized onions and Swiss cheese.

Recipe Ingredients List:
	- 1 lb (500 g) Beef Eye of Round Oven Roast, centre cut (3 to 4 inches/7.5 to 10 cm diameter), tied
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) fresh ground pepper
	- ¼ tsp (1 mL) salt
	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) vegetable oil
	- ½ tsp (2 mL) dried rosemary, crumbled
	- ¼ tsp (1 mL) garlic powder (optional)
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1 lb (500 g)  Beef Eye of Round Oven Roast,  centre cut (3 to 4 inches/7.5 to 10 cm diameter), tied
	- Fresh ground pepper
	- Salt
	- Vegetable oil
	- Dried rosemary
	- Garlic powder (optional)
Recipe Methods:
	1. Set up water bath for sous vide and preheat to 130°F (54.5°C) for medium-rare or 140°F (60°C) for medium according to manufacturer’s directions.
	2. Pat beef dry with paper towel and season all over with pepper and salt. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a skillet. Brown roast, turning to brown all sides. Transfer to a plate and let cool slightly. 
	 3. Rub beef with rosemary and garlic powder (if using). Place in a medium bag for sous vide (vacuum, sealable freezer or reusable silicone). Remove as much air as possible and vacuum or manually seal. 
	4. Immerse bag in preheated water bath and secure it to the side of the pot with a clip, keeping the top of the bag above the surface of the water. Cover water bath with foil or plastic to reduce evaporation. Cook sous vide for 36 hours, replenishing water as necessary.
	5. Remove beef from water bath. To serve cold, chill in a bowl of ice water, replenishing ice as necessary until cooled, then refrigerate for 1 hour. (Make ahead: Chilled roast can be refrigerated in the bag for up to 3 days.) 
	6. To serve warm, immediately remove beef from bag, discarding liquid and transfer to a cutting board. Carve across the grain into thin slices and serve on warmed plates.
Recipe Tips:
  - This works best with the centre-cut portion of the Eye of Round that is 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) in diameter for even cooking. You can cook more than one roast at a time, just place each piece in separate bag and ensure there is plenty of space in the water bath to circulate around each roast to cook evenly. If you prefer a hotter temperature for serving, you can pat the cooked roast dry after removing from the bag and give it another quick sear in a hot, oiled skillet before slicing.

Recipe Title: Grilled Souvlaki-Style Beef Skewers
Recipe Summary: The beef in this recipe gets served off the skewer into a warm pita but would also be great served over rice or with roasted potatoes. To prevent beef cubes from spinning on the stick during cooking, thread beef cubes fairly tightly together on the skewer (without squishing) as the beef cubes will shrink in size as they cook.

	- 3 cloves garlic, minced
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) EACH dried oregano leaves and salt
	- ½ tsp (2 mL) fresh ground pepper
	- 1 lb (500 g) Beef Sirloin Tip Marinating Steak, 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick
	- 4 long bamboo skewers
	- 4 large pitas 
	- 2 cups (500 mL) shredded romaine lettuce
	- 1 cup (250 mL) finely chopped tomato
	- ¼ cup (60 mL) finely chopped onion
	- ½ cup (125 mL) prepared tzatziki
Recipe Shopping List:
	- Olive oil
	- Fresh lemon juice
	- Red wine vinegar
	- 3 cloves garlic
	- Dried oregano leaves
	- Salt
	- Fresh ground pepper
	- 1 lb (500 g) Beef Sirloin Tip Marinating Steak, 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick
	- 4 long bamboo skewers
	- 4 large pitas 
	- Romaine lettuce
	- Tomato
	- Onion
	- Prepared tzatziki
Recipe Methods:
	1. Combine olive oil, lemon juice, vinegar, garlic, oregano, salt and pepper in a large sealable freezer bag. Pierce steak all over with fork, cut into 1- inch (2.5 cm) cubes and add to bag, massaging marinade into meat; seal and refrigerate for 4 hours. Meanwhile, soak skewers in water for at least 30 minutes.
	2. Discard marinade from meat. Pat beef cubes dry with paper towel. Thread beef cubes evenly onto skewers.
	3. Grill skewers in a closed preheated barbecue over medium-high heat (400°F/200°C) for 8 to 10 minutes, turning to brown on all sides, until cooked to 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare doneness at the least (or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done). Lightly grill pitas during the last 1 to 2 minutes of cooking, or until just warmed.
	4. Remove beef from skewers. Place pitas on serving plates. Arrange lettuce, beef, tomato, onions and tzatziki evenly over warm pitas; serve immediately.
Recipe Tips:
  - Bamboo skewers need to be soaked in cold water for at least 30 minutes before using to avoid charring. You can use metal skewers instead, which do not require soaking; however, they draw the heat into the centre of the beef and can cook meat faster, so cooking time may need to be adjusted. Cutting beef into 1-inch (2.5 cm) cubes is perfect for grilling–any smaller and you risk over cooking the meat.

Recipe Title: Grilled Sous Vide Steak with White Bean and Arugula Salad
Recipe Summary: Cooking a grilling steak sous vide takes the guesswork out of cooking to a perfect doneness–the temperature you set your water bath is the internal temperature your steak will cook to, every time! Evenly cooked (all the way through), juicy, tender steak is definitely worth the longer cooking time. A quick, hot sear at the end adds that delicious browning. The accompanying salad with white beans and arugula makes a nice change from your typical garden salad.

Recipe Title: Beef Samosa
Recipe Summary: Spiced ground beef enveloped in pastry and fried to perfection, these beef samosas make the best kind of appetizer. I prefer using lean ground beef for this recipe. Traditionally samosas are deep-fried though sometimes when we get uncooked samosas from our families we use the air fryer. The samosa wrappers can be found in the freezer section in well-stocked supermarkets and at Southeast Asian grocery stores.

	6. Deep-fry samosas, a few at a time to avoid crowding pot, turning once, for about 10 to 12 minutes, until golden and crisp. Transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain. Serve hot or at room temperature. 
Recipe Tips:
  - *For the garlic and gingerroot paste, you can use the purée or paste found in jars in the grocery store or use a fine grater, such as a Microplane, to make your own purée in small amounts just as you need it. **Ground red chili pepper is available in Indian grocery stores and well-stocked supermarkets. It is ground up dried red chili peppers and may be labeled as lal merch. Cayenne can be substituted but has a harsher flavour so you may wish to use less. You can test that your frying oil is hot enough for cooking adding a piece of wrapper to the hot oil. If it is ready, the wrapper will float to the top. If you have an air fryer, arrange samosas in the air fryer basket, leaving space between each. Follow the manufacturer’s directions to air fry the samosas until golden and crisp.

Recipe Title: Ground Beef Stir-Fry with Holy Basil and Fried Egg (Pad Gaprao Neua)
Recipe Summary: If I had to pick a national dish of Thailand, this would be it. It’s a simple stir-fry that features the flavour of holy basil. Holy basil is hard to find here, but at my parents’ house in Thailand it grows like weeds! There are holy basil plants literally sprouting up from the cracks in the pavement, wherever the seeds fall so this dish reminds me very much of my mother’s abundant home garden. Holy basil is nearly impossible to find in Canada, but the good news is that good old Italian basil works fantastically as a substitute and has a close enough flavour that it satisfies my cravings just fine. Thai basil, if you can find it, will also be delicious though the flavour will be quite different. A Thai-style fried egg is a classic accompaniment, and a must-have if you ask me. What makes them Thai-style is the fact that they’re fried in a lot of oil to get crispy, browned bubbly edges. I’ve provided 2 different methods for frying the eggs, depending on the desired doneness of the yolk. This recipe is the traditional version of this pad gaprao, which is very simple, with no vegetables and seasoned simply with fish sauce and sugar. More modern versions include vegetables such as onions and long beans and involve more complex seasonings such as oyster sauce and dark soy sauce.

	- Stir-fry
		- 2 to 3 Thai chili peppers

		- ¼ cup (60 mL) water or no-salt-added chicken broth (approx)
		- ½ tsp (2 mL) pepper
		- 1¼ cups (300 mL) holy basil or regular basil leaves 
	- Thai-style Fried Eggs
		- Canola or sunflower oil
		- 3 eggs
		- Hot cooked jasmine rice
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 3 to 5 Thai chili peppers
	- Fish sauce 
	- 1 lime
	- Garlic
	- Mild red peppers (see Tip)
	- Holy basil or regular basil leaves 
	- ¾ lb (375 g) Lean Ground Beef 
	- Canola or sunflower oil
	- No-salt-added chicken broth (optional)
	- Granulated sugar
	- Pepper
	- Jasmine rice
	- Eggs
Recipe Methods:
	1. Prik Nam Pla (if using): Combine Thai chilies, fish sauce and lime juice in a small bowl. Let stand while you make the stir-fry.
	2. Stir-fry: Pound Thai chilies, to taste, into a fine paste using a mortar and pestle. Add garlic and chopped mild peppers and pound just into a coarse paste. Set aside.
	3. Heat a wok or a large skillet over high heat until very hot then add beef and spread it out. Sear beef without moving until the underside is browned. Toss the beef and cook until beef starts to release liquid; cook, stirring, until all juices have evaporated, and the beef starts to sizzle in its own fat. Once the beef is sizzling, cook, without stirring, for 15 to 20 seconds to brown the beef and develop flavour, then toss, and repeat the browning 1 to 2 more times.
	4. Reduce heat medium and push beef to one side of the pan. Tilt the pan so remaining oil covers empty side of pan. If there isn’t much oil in the pan, add enough oil to the empty side to make 1 to 2 tbsp (15 to 30 mL). Add the garlic paste to the oiled side of the pan and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds until aromatic and the garlic starts to turn golden; toss it with the beef.&nbsp;
	5. Increase heat to high then add ¼ cup (60 mL) water, fish sauce and sugar; toss to mix well.&nbsp; Add the julienned mild peppers and cook, tossing, for 30 seconds; if it’s looking too dry, add a splash more water or broth.&nbsp;
	6. Turn off heat, add basil and toss just until wilted. Taste and adjust seasoning with more sugar or fish sauce as needed or add a little more water if it feels too dry. Set aside while you fry the eggs.
	7. Thai-style Fried Eggs: Fry eggs 1 at a time to prevent them from sticking to each other. There are 2 options for frying eggs:&nbsp;
	For crispy whites and semi-set yolk: Pour about ¼&nbsp;inch (0.5 cm) of oil into a small nonstick skillet. Heat over medium-high heat until hot. Add 1 egg and cook until egg white starts to bubble. Use a spoon to occasionally baste the top of the egg with oil to cook the yolk, and. cook until whites are crispy and browned around the edges and the yolk is set to your liking. Transfer to a plate with a slotted spatula and repeat with remaining eggs, adding more oil to pan as needed.&nbsp;
	For eggs with crispy whites and runny yolk: Working with 1 egg at a time, separate the egg white and the egg yolk. Pour about ¼ inch (0.5 cm) of oil to a small nonstick skillet. Heat over medium-high heat until hot. Add egg white and cook until edges start to turn brown, using a spatula to push down the middle of the white down to make an indent for the yolk to sit in. Cook until browned around the edges, then carefully place the yolk on top of the white, and cook, using a spoon to baste some oil around the edges of the egg yolk to help it stick to the egg white. Transfer to a plate with a slotted spatula and repeat with remaining eggs, adding more oil to pan as needed.
	8. Spoon hot jasmine rice onto 3 serving plates, spoon the beef over half of the rice, and top everything with a fried egg. Drizzle the Prik Nam Pla on top of the egg, if desired.
Recipe Tips:
  - The mild red chilies are for colour and flavour, and the Thai chilies are for heat. While the mild ones can be a sweet red pepper, preferably you want to use something with thinner flesh and not as watery, such as red Anaheim, Shepherd or mini sweet pepper.

On the opposite side, thread a second skewer, through the three strips of steak so strips are arranged horizontally between skewers. Repeat process with remaining steak. 
	5. Grill in a closed preheated barbecue over medium-high heat (400°F/200°C) for 6 to 8 minutes for ½ inch (1 cm) thick steak, turning twice or more, or until a digital instant-read thermometer inserted sideways into centre of steak reads 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare at the least. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes.
	6. To Serve: Whisk ¼ cup (60 mL) water, peanut butter and chili sauce into reserved marinade to make peanut sauce. Remove skewers and serve steak strips in lettuce leaves topped with peanut sauce, green onions and peanuts with a side of Mango Salad. Serve with lime wedges. 
Recipe Tips:
  - Indoor method: Omit skewers. Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) vegetable oil in a cast iron or heavy-bottom skillet set over medium-high heat. Cook steak strips, in batches as necessary, turning at least twice, for 5 to 6 minutes for medium-rare (145°F/63°C) at the least.

Recipe Title: Mom’s Mikma Chili and Bannock
Recipe Summary: My mom's recipe may sound like a basic chili except that traditionally she would use bison and it was never too spicy. When I smell it now, it takes me back to setting the table and us kids getting excited because we just knew it was going to be a good dinner. Everything in the fridge used to go into the chili, even raw apples. When the huge pot was placed on the table, all of us kids would dip into it with bannock or bread. I’ve recreated her recipe using two different beef cuts to achieve an almost-perfect replica. Enjoy.

Add cubes of beef and ground beef to the pan and cook for about 10 minutes, breaking up ground beef with back of a spoon and turning beef cubes, until browned. Add bay leaves, hot pepper flakes to your taste, pepper, black beans, navy beans and crushed tomatoes. Cook, stirring often, for 15 minutes or until ground beef is completely cooked.

Recipe Title: Beer and Spiced Braised Beef (Draadjesvlees) 
Recipe Summary: My Oma always told me that all you need is a Dutch oven and you can make a delicious meal. Of course, it’s no surprise the Dutch created the Dutch oven—a staple in most households these days—since they are the kings of slow cooking. Draadjesvlees simply means threaded meat and is typically cooked with various spices such as juniper berries, cloves and cinnamon. I add a bottle of “hoppy” beer to create depth of flavor and let the Dutch oven do the hard work. Serve the stew with Dutch potatoes, rice or pasta.

Recipe Title: Easy Beef Shawarma Stir-Fry Strip Skewers (Inside Round) 
Recipe Summary: This is a simple way to stretch your steak budget: taking a less premium steak–such as inside round as stir-fry strips–that you marinate to optimize tenderness. The shawarma flavours are on-trend and you can get two meals from one: serve over rice with a side salad for dinner and then in a pita with salad the next day for lunch! Enjoy with store-bought hummus, and tzatziki for a speedy meal that is both healthy and satisfying.

	1. Combine cumin, paprika, turmeric, coriander, granulated garlic, onion powder, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger and ¼ tsp (1 mL) each salt and pepper in a small bowl. 
	2. Pat beef strips dry with paper towel and place in a reusable container; add lemon zest and juice, garlic to your taste, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Stir to coat. Add spice mixture, stirring to ensure the beef is evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate overnight or for up to 24 hours.
	3. Remove beef from marinade; discard marinade. Pat beef dry with paper towel; season all over with salt to your taste. Thread beef onto metal skewers like a ribbon: starting with one end of the beef strip, push it through the skewer; fold the beef over and push through the skewer and repeat until each piece is threaded along on the skewer, pushing ribbon tightly together. Repeat with remaining beef strips and skewers.
	4. Grill on preheated barbecue over high heat (500°F/260°C) for 4 to 6 minutes per side or cooked to medium-rare at the least (145°F/63°C). Transfer to plate and let rest for 10 minutes.
	Set up your grill for direct-heat cooking. Place lit charcoal directly in the centre of the grill, where you plan to cook the skewers. If you’re looking for a smokier flavour, add a couple chunks of wood to the lit coals before adding the grill grate. Sugar maple or apple wood would be a nice flavour pairing with this recipe. Close the lid and allow the grill to preheat to 500°F (260°C), for approximately 10 to 12 minutes. Grill the skewers, with the lid closed, on the grill grate directly over top of the coals for 4 to 6 minutes per side or cooked to medium-rare at the least (145°F/63°C). Transfer to plate and let rest for 10 minutes.&nbsp;

	- 2 shallots
	- Garlic, chopped
	- Fresh thyme
	- Panko bread crumbs
	- 2 lb (1 kg) Lean Ground Beef
	- 16 thin slices prosciutto (about 8 oz/250 g)
	- Dijon mustard
	- Prepared horseradish
	- Worcestershire sauce
	- Onion powder
	- Garlic powder
	- Salt

	- All-purpose flour
	- 2 sheets frozen or prepared cold puff pastry (about 1 lb/500 g) 
	- Eggs
	- Unsalted butter
	- Marsala wine
	- For Marsala Mushroom Sauce (optional)
	- 8 oz (250 g) cremini mushrooms, sliced
	- Beef broth
	- All-purpose flour
	- 1 cup (250 mL) Marsala wine
	- Unsalted butter
Recipe Methods:
	1. Duxelles: Combine mushrooms, shallots, garlic and thyme in a food processor; pulse until finely chopped.&nbsp;
	2. Heat a large sauté pan or skillet over medium heat; add butter and swirl until melted. Add the mushroom mixture, Marsala, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, for 10 to 12 minutes or until most of the liquid has evaporated. Set aside to cool.
	3. Once cooled, use a cheesecloth or fine mesh strainersieve to drain the mushroom mixture of any remaining liquid; discard liquid. Separate mushroom mixture into 8 equal portions and set aside until ready to assemble.
	4. Beef Patties: Beat eggs, Dijon mustard, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder with a fork in a large bowl. Mix in bread crumbs, then ground beef with the fork until thoroughly combined (careful not to over-mix). Scoop beef using a ½-cup (125 mL) measuring cup and form into 8 equal beef patties, about 1¼ inches (3 cm) thick. Place on a plate.
	5. To Assemble: Roll out one sheet of the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to a 12-inch (30 cm) square, then cut into 4 equal squares.
	6. Lay 2 pieces of prosciutto onto each square of puff pastry, overlapping as necessary (the prosciutto will extend beyond the pastry square). Place one beef patty on top of the prosciutto; place one portion of the mushroom mixture on top of each beef patty and flatten out into an even layer. Flip the beef patty over so the mushroom mixture is sitting on the prosciutto. Fold the prosciutto slices over the beef to completely wrap the patty. Flip the bundle over, so the prosciutto ends are on the puff pastry.
	7. Fold the puff pastry up and over the prosciutto-wrapped patty as though wrapping a package. Using a pastry brush or your finger, dampen the puff pastry at each edge where the pastry folds over itself to securely seal all edges. Place the individual packages seam-side up on a large parchment paper-lined baking sheet, spacing them apart. Repeat with the remaining puff pastry and filling.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	8. Beat 2 tbsp (30 mL) water into the eggs in a small bowl to make an egg wash. Brush mixture over the tops and sides of each package. Pierce each Wellington with a sharp knife to create a ½-inch (1 cm) vent on top.
	9. Bake in preheated to 400°F oven for about 40 to 45 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown and a digital instant-read thermometer inserted sideways into each patty reads 160°F (71°C). Transfer Wellingtons on baking sheet to a rack and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
	10. Marsala Mushroom Sauce (if using): Melt butter over medium-high heat in a large sauté pan or skillet. Cook mushrooms and thyme, stirring, for 7 to 8 minutes or until starting to soften. Sprinkle with flour and cook, stirring for 1 minute. Add Marsala and cook, stirring, for 1 minute; add beef broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring often, for about 5 to 8 minutes until sauce is thickened. Serve alongside the Individual Ground Beef Wellingtons.
Recipe Tips:
  - To make ahead, prepare the Duxelles Beef and Patties and wrap in prosciutto. Wrap well and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. You can assemble the puff pastry packages up to 2 hours in advance. Cover and refrigerate, then brush with egg wash just before baking. In place of the Mushroom Marsala Sauce, you can make your favourite beef gravy to accompany the Ground Beef Wellingtons.

	- 1 stalk celery
	- 2 cloves garlic
	- 1 lb (500 g) Medium Ground Beef 
	- Smoked paprika 
	- Worcestershire sauce
Recipe Methods:
	1. Carrot Chips: Cut carrot crosswise into very thin slices using a mandolin or sharp knife. Arrange in a single layer on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet&nbsp; and season lightly with salt and sugar. Dehydrate for 8 hours in a preheated 150°F oven or until crispy. Let cool completely. Set aside. (Make ahead: Chips can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days).
	2. Broth: Combine peppercorns, fennel seeds and dill seeds in a large pot. Toast over low heat, stirring, just until fragrant. Add chicken, carrots, onions, thyme, bay leaves and chicken stock. Bring to a simmer. Simmer, skimming often, for 2½ hours. 
	3. Turn off heat and add parsley and dill. Let stand to infuse herbs for 30 minutes. Strain through a cheesecloth-lined colander into another large pot; discard solids. Season with salt and ground pepper. Set aside. (Make ahead: The broth can be cooled, covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days.)
	4. Dill Oil: Meanwhile, combine dill, parsley, salt and oil in a blender. Blend until the mixture is very smooth and starts to warm slightly. Pour through a cheesecloth-lined sieve set over a measuring cup or bowl and let oil drain. Discard solids and transfer green oil into a squeeze bottle. Set aside at room temperature. (Make ahead: Oil can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.)
	5. Dough: Combine flour and eggs in a food processor or stand mixer fitted with dough hook and process or mix until a smooth dough forms. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead for several minutes until the dough springs back when pressed with fingers. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 1 hour. 
	6. Filling: Cook carrot, onion, celery and garlic over medium heat in a large skillet, stirring occasionally, for about 7 minutes or until translucent and just starting to soften. Remove from heat, transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until cold.
	7. Combine cold vegetable mixture, ground beef, thyme, parsley, dill, smoked paprika, Worcestershire sauce, egg and rice in a stand mixer with paddle attachment or bowl. Mix or knead by hand until the filling comes together and has a tacky feel. Season with salt and pepper to your taste. 
	8. Kreplach Assembly: Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface using a rolling pin until very thin (about ⅛ to 1/16 inch/1 to 2 mm thick), see Tip. Cut out rounds using a 3-inch (8 cm) round cutter, cutting a total of 40 rounds of dough. Discard the trim.
	9. Whisk egg with 2 tbsp (30 mL) water in a small bowl to make egg wash. Working with a few at a time, place 2 tbsp (30 mL) of the filling in the centre of each round, brush edges of dough with the egg wash. Fold dough in half over filling to create a half-moon shape; pinch around the edges to seal. Place kreplach on a floured baking sheet, spacing them apart; cover and refrigerate until ready to poach, for up to 12 hours.
	10. To Serve: Bring chicken broth to a boil over medium-high heat in a large saucepan. Bring another pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add kreplach to boiling water, in batches as necessary to avoid crowding the pot, and cook for about 3 minutes or until dumplings are al dente and filling is thoroughly cooked. Lift from boiling water using a slotted spoon or metal sieve and place 5 kreplach into each warmed serving bowl.
	11. Garnish with a carrot chip and fresh herbs, as desired. Ladle hot broth into each bowl until it half submerges the beef kreplach. Squeeze a couple of dollops of dill oil around the broth and serve immediately. 
Recipe Tips: ???
Recipe Tips:
  - When rolling out the dough you’ll need a very large work surface as the dough must be very thin. Divide the dough in half or thirds and roll out in batches, as necessary, keeping the remaining dough wrapped and the filling separately and in the refrigerator until needed. Extra carrot chips can be enjoyed as a snack or as a chip for dipping, or as a salad or carrot dessert garnish. Extra dill oil can be incorporated into a vinaigrette, for fish crudo or in a marinade.

Reserve approximately 2 cups (500 mL) of sauce for dipping.
	4. Unwrap ribs and drain off liquid. Brush ribs all over with the remaining sauce. If desired, grill over medium-high heat for 2 to 3 minutes, turning once, until ribs are grill-marked and glazed. Cut between ribs and serve with the reserved sauce for dipping.
Recipe Tips:
  - Use bottled smoky-flavoured barbecue sauce instead of making one from scratch for basting and dipping. You’ll need 2 to 3 cups (500 to 750 mL).

Recipe Title: Porcini-Rubbed Oven Roast with Red Wine Sauce
Recipe Summary: The combination of mushrooms, beef and red wine is a classic that’s always a favourite. The ground porcini mushrooms create a delicious crust on the roast and provide big flavour to the gravy.

	9. To serve, carve beef across the grain into thin slices and serve with Mushroom Barley and Sautéed Mushrooms; top with Finishing Sauce.
Recipe Tips:
  - Patting beef dry before cooking helps bump up beef flavour since the beef browns better.

Recipe Title: Thai Yellow Curry with Beef (Gaeng Garee Nuea)
Recipe Summary: In Thailand, yellow curry or gaeng garee is a specialty of Thai Muslims, so beef is a common meat pairing. In Thailand, when we make curry with beef, we like to cook it separately from the curry sauce so that the curry will maintain bright colour, and it also saves time as the curry sauce can be made while the beef is being cooked. I’ve chosen the well-marbled top blade steak for this as it isn’t too lean, and it’s also not too chewy which reduces the amount of cooking time. Since beef can take a long time to tenderize, the way to make this curry weeknight-friendly is to thinly slice the beef rather than cutting it into large cubes; a trick I learned working in a Thai restaurant. This will also allow the flavor of the curry to penetrate the beef in a shorter amount of time. Another stew-friendly cut can also be used, though it may take longer to cook. Serve the curry with steamed jasmine rice.

	- 1½ lb (750 g) Beef Top Blade Simmering Steaks 
	- Salt
	- 5 to 6 tbsp (75 to 90 mL) Thai yellow curry paste (store bought or see recipe)
	- 2 cups (500 mL) coconut milk
	- Palm sugar or brown sugar
	- Tamarind paste
	- Fish sauce
	- Homemade Yellow Curry Paste
	- 1 stalk lemongrass
	- Gingerroot 
	- Galangal
	- Fresh turmeric (or ground turmeric)
	- Garlic
	- Shallots
	- Dried mild chilies
	- Coriander seeds
	- Cumin seeds
	- White peppercorns
	- Salt
	- Curry powder
	- Fermented shrimp paste
Recipe Methods:
	1. Slice the steak across the grain into ⅛-inch (3 mm) thick slices and place in a saucepan. Add enough water to completely submerge the beef; add salt and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of the curry paste. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes or until fork tender.
	2. Meanwhile, bring ¾ cup (175 mL) coconut milk to a boil over medium-high heat in a large heavy saucepan. Stir in remaining curry paste, mixing well. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring constantly, for 5 to 8 minutes or until very thick and coconut oil separates from the paste (the oil may not separate depending on the coconut milk you’re using; this is okay).
	3. Stir in remaining coconut milk, 4 tsp (20 mL) sugar, 1 tbsp (15 mL) of the tamarind paste and 1 tbsp (15 mL) of the fish sauce and bring to a boil. Add potatoes and onion and simmer for 5 minutes (the potatoes should not be fully cooked at this point). Remove from heat and set aside.
	4. When beef is tender, use a slotted spoon to transfer the beef into the curry sauce. Stir in just enough of the beef cooking liquid to keep beef and vegetables barely submerged.&nbsp;
	5. Bring curry to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 to 7 minutes or until the potatoes are tender. Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning with more fish sauce, tamarind or sugar as needed.
	6. Stir in the tomatoes. Turn off heat and allow the tomatoes to soften in the residual heat for about 1 minute.

Serve these hearty flatbreads as a main course with a side salad or cut each naan crosswise into 4 slices to serve as appetizers. Note: the recipe was developed and tested on The Big Green Egg brand of charcoal grill/smoker. Most charcoal grills are similar; vents and lids differ but have the same purpose. Always refer to the user manual for light up, heating instructions and indirect-heat and direct-heat cooking for your grill. To use a gas grill, see the alternate method below.

Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1 small red onion
	- Garlic
	- 1 tomato
	- Fresh basil
	- Fresh sturdy herb sprigs, such as rosemary and sage (optional)
	- 2 naan flatbreads, each about 9½ x 6½ inches (24 x 16 cm)

	- Olive oil 
	- Balsamic vinegar
	- Balsamic glaze
	- Salt
	- Pepper
	- Traditional ricotta cheese
	- Natural lump charcoal
Recipe Methods:
	1. Load fire bowl of kamado-style grill with&nbsp;natural lump charcoal in an even 2-inch (5 cm) thick layer. Light the charcoal with a paper towel in the coals or charcoal-safe fire starter and place the diffuser plate in the fire bowl. Fill a foil drip pan part way with water, adding herb sprigs (if using) and place on the plate (see Tip). Place the grill grate over the diffuser plate. Close lid and preheat to Low (250°F/121°C), adjusting the top and bottom vent to achieve this constant temperature.
	2. Pat steak dry with paper towel. Pierce steak all over with a fork and season liberally with salt. Place the steak on preheated grill, insert an oven-safe programmable thermometer sideways into steak and close the lid. Cook for about 22 minutes or until thermometer registers 135°F (57°C). 
	3. Reverse Marinade: Meanwhile, combine onion, garlic, oil, vinegar and salt and pepper, to your taste, in a shallow dish that will fit the cooked steak. Set aside.
	4. Transfer partially-cooked steak to a clean plate and set aside. Remove the diffuser plate and drip pan; lower the grill grate closer to the charcoal for high-temperature, direct-heat grilling. Brush the grate clean and close the lid. Adjust vents as necessary to heat to a temperature of about 600°F (315°C); this should take about 2 to 5 minutes. 
	5. Return steak to grill, and sear over high heat with grill lid open for 1 to 2 minutes per side or until thermometer registers 145°F (63° C) for medium-rare (or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done). Remove the steak from the grill and place it directly into the Reverse Marinade. Let rest for 10 to 12 minutes. 
	6. Bruschetta: Meanwhile, combine tomato, onion, garlic, basil, oil and vinegar in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.
	7. Transfer steak to a cutting board and carve across the grain into thin slices. Return to marinade and stir to coat.&nbsp;Set aside.
	8. To Serve: Grill naan over direct heat until lightly toasted and grill marked on both sides. Transfer to a clean cutting board.&nbsp;
	9. Spread ricotta evenly over naan and top with Bruschetta mixture, dividing equally. Arrange steak slices on top and drizzle with balsamic glaze. Cut each naan in half to serve. 
	Gas Grilling Method: You can use the reverse-sear method in a three-burner gas grill, too! Simply turn on the two end burners, leaving the centre burner off; place drip tray over unlit burner. This is your indirect heat zone, where you’ll put your steak. Turn the end burners to low heat and preheat grill to 250°F (121°C). Cook steak in closed barbecue over unlit burner for about 22 minutes or until thermometer registers 135°F (57°C). Remove the steak and drip pan from the grill. Turn all burners to High and preheat for about 10 minutes, until the grill is 600°F (315°C). Return steak to grill and sear over high heat for 1 to 2 minutes per side or until thermometer registers 145°F (63° C) for medium-rare (or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done).
Recipe Tips:
  - The drip pan with water under the steak provides moisture during grilling and including hearty herbs in the drip-pan water permeates the air inside the grill with an herbaceous aroma, adding a subtle nuanced flavour to the beef. If you have a half-moon plate/griddle diffuser accessory for your barbecue, cook steak over the diffuser for the indirect heat cook, and then transfer steak to side directly over the coals to sear and complete the cooking. If you don’t have any type of diffuser, push the charcoal to one side and place the drip pan under the grill on the other side for indirect-heat cooking. When ready to sear, move the steak over to the live coal side of the grill.

Recipe Title: Dutch Meatballs (Bitterballen)
Recipe Summary: This classic pub food was one of the first Dutch dishes I recall eating at a restaurant and it is usually the first item my Dutch friends ask me to make. Its creamy beef filling and crispy exterior make it hard to eat just one so luckily this recipe will make more than enough to satisfy your group. We typically use a spicy Dijon mustard to cut through the richness of the filling but you can serve it with any mustard you like (or none at all!).

Recipe Title: Stuffed Grape Leaves (Dolmeh Barg-e Mo)
Recipe Summary: Dolmeh is a very common dish in Middle Eastern/Mediterranean countries. Dolmeh (also called dolma) is a term given to a variety of stuffed vegetables such as sweet peppers, zucchini, onions, cabbage, etc. There are many dolmeh recipes with different ingredients depending on the region from where it originates. Dolmeh Barge-e Mo means stuffed grape leaves in Farsi. The best grape leaves are usually found in spring and summer. Fresh leaves might be hard to find so most people use canned or jarred versions. Dolmeh can be either sour or sweet-sour; they can be wrapped as very thin rolls or in a square shape. I remember my grandma had a grape vine in her house and when grape leaves were in season, we would have a ritual of making dolmeh. My mom used to take me and my sister to my grandma’s house where she would already had grape leaves washed and the stuffing ready. We would sit for hours wrapping dolmeh tightly and thinly. She taught me how to make this dish with all the tips and tricks, how to be careful with delicate grape leaves and how to patch two leaves together if they had a hole so there is no waste. This dish is usually served with thick yogurt and with or without bread.

	- 1½ tsp (7 mL) EACH fresh ground pepper and ground turmeric
	- 1 lb 10 oz (800 g) grape leaves (fresh or jarred)
	- Juice of ½ lemon
	- Plain Greek yogurt

	- Green onions
	- Garlic
	- 1 large onion
	- Fresh parsley

	- Basmati rice
	- 1 lb 10 oz (800 g) grape leaves (fresh or jarred)
	- Plain Greek yogurt
Recipe Methods:
	1. Place rice in a medium bowl, add cold water and swish the rice. Drain off water and repeat 3 more times until the water in the bowl is somewhat clear. Drain rice well.
	2. Place rice in a medium saucepan and fill the pot with cold water. Bring to a boil over
	medium-high heat; boil for 4 to 5 minutes or until rice grains are partly cooked (the middle of the grains should be still hard). Drain the rice in a sieve or fine colander and immediately rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process. Set aside to drain.
	3. Combine onion, green onion, garlic, parsley, dill and mint in a large bowl. Add drained rice, 1 cup (250 mL) yogurt, 1 tbsp (15 mL) of the olive oil, marzeh (if using), salt, pepper and turmeric. Mix in ground beef with a fork until all the ingredients are well combined (using your hands for mixing, if necessary).
	4. Spread 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil in the bottom of a large pot. Arrange enough grape leaves in pot to make a layer across the bottom.
	5. To wrap dolmeh, trim stems from grape leaves. Lay a leaf on a board with the shiny side down. Add about 4 tsp (20 mL) stuffing in the center of the leaf. Fold the sides and the bottom of the leaf to the middle over the filling and roll up tightly. Place in the pot. Repeat this process until all the leaves are rolled, packing the rolled dolmehs in the pot very tightly together and layering as necessary.
	6. Drizzle the remaining olive oil and lemon juice over the dolmehs. Place an ovenproof plate upside down on top of the dolmehs and press it a bit down. (This way they won’t move once you add the water to the pot.) Add enough water to cover the dolmehs.
	7. Cover and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Simmer for 1 hour. Remove the plate and add more water, if necessary to keep moist. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove one dolmeh from the pot and test for doneness: the leaf and rice should be tender and the beef thoroughly cooked. If not, add a bit more water, cover and simmer until cooked through.
	8. Remove from heat and let rest for about 30 minutes. Serve dolmeh with Greek yogurt.

	- Olive oil
	- Dijon mustard
	- Fresh basil
	- Fresh rosemary
	- 1 clove garlic
	- 1½ lb (750 g)Beef Wing Steaks, ½ inch (1 cm) thick (about 2)
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper
	- 2 oz (60 g) Gorgonzola, other blue cheese or goat cheese, crumbled
Recipe Methods:
	1. Whisk together vinegar, oil, mustard, half the basil, rosemary and garlic in a large shallow dish. Add steaks and turn to coat evenly with marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 15 minutes. 
	2. Remove beef from marinade; discard marinade Pat steaks dry with paper towel. and season all over with salt and pepper. 
	3. Position the oven rack in the top-third of the oven (but not the very top). Place steaks on a rack on a rimmed baking sheet and broil for 6 to 8 minutes for ½ inch (1 cm) thick steaks, turning twice or more and topping steaks with cheese in the last 2 minutes of broiling, until a digital instant-read thermometer inserted sideways into centre of steak reads 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare doneness at the least. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes.
	 4. Carve steaks off the bone and cut into thin slices across the grain. Serve sliced steak on a platter along with the bones and sprinkle with remaining basil.
Recipe Tips:
  - Cooking steaks under the broiler produces a sear and caramelization similar to that of the barbecue and can be done in any weather any time of year. Like grilling, the rendering fat on a steak can sometimes cause flare-ups, so be sure to stay close by. Consult the owner’s manual of your oven to learn if the door to the oven should be fully closed or left ajar during broiling.

	- Corn tortillas
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 2 lb (1 kg)  Beef Honeycomb Tripe 
	- 1½ lb (750 g)  Beef Soup Bones,  2-inch (5 cm) pieces
	- Salt
	- Onions
	- 6 cloves garlic
	- Dried oregano, preferably Mexican

	- 2 limes
	- Fresh cilantro
	- Ground chilies, such as piquín
	- Sliced serrano chilies or hot pepper sauce 
	- Corn tortillas
Recipe Methods:
	1. Place the tripe and soup bones in a large pot. Add cold water to cover by 1 inch (2.5 cm) and add 1 tbsp (15 mL) salt. Bring to a boil and cook for 10 minutes. Drain through a colander, discarding water. Rinse the tripe and bones well in cold water.
	2. Cut the tripe into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces. Return to the pot with the bones. Add 5 quarts (5 L) fresh water, onion, garlic, oregano and 1½ tsp (7 mL) salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours until the tripe is barely tender, replenishing the liquid as necessary to keep it just above the meat.
	3. Meanwhile, snip off the stem end of each chili pepper with scissors and split each chili open lengthwise. Open up and scrape out seeds and membranes. Heat a heavy medium-size skillet over medium heat. To toast the chilies, place one or two in the pan skin side down and press it with a metal spatula until it softens and blisters. Flip the chili over and toast the inside being careful not to burn it. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and continue with the remaining chilies. Pour boiling water over the chilies and let soak while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
	4. Add cumin seeds to the pan and toast until fragrant. Remove to a plate and let cool. Grind to a powder with a mortar and pestle or in a spice grinder.
	5. When the tripe is almost tender, drain the chiles, discarding soaking water. Place chilies in a blender with 1 cup (250 mL) of the cooking liquid from the pot; purée until smooth. Add another cup (250 mL) of the cooking liquid and blend again. Press through a fine-meshed sieve into the pot of soup; discard solids. 
	6. Add toasted cumin, cloves and hominy to the pot; simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour or until meat is tender. Add water to thin it out to a soup consistency, if necessary. Season with salt to taste.
	7. Place the garnishes in bowls on the table and serve the soup, bones and all, for each person to garnish the soup to taste. Serve tortillas alongside.
Recipe Tips:
  - Tripe should be rinsed or blanched before proceeding to cook. Shallow slashes on the smoother side of the tripe will help reduce curling during cooking.

	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) vegetable oil
	- 1 clove garlic, minced

	- ¾ cup (175 mL) reduced-sodium beef broth 
	- ⅓ cup (75 mL) dry red wine
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) whole berry cranberry sauce or red pepper jelly
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) cold butter, cut into cubes
	- Chopped fresh parsley 
Recipe Shopping List:
	- ½ lb (250 g) Beef Inside Round Fast-fry Steaks (about 2 steaks)
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper
	- Vegetable oil
	- 1 clove garlic
	- Fresh rosemary
	- Reduced-sodium beef broth
	- Dry red wine
	- Whole berry cranberry sauce or red pepper jelly
	- Butter
	- Fresh parsley
Recipe Methods:
	1. Pat steaks dry with paper towel; season all over with salt and pepper.
	 2. Heat oil over medium-high heat in nonstick skillet; cook steaks, for 4 to 6 minutes, turning once or more until steaks are cooked to medium (160ºF/71ºF) and browned but still pink inside. Transfer to a plate, cover loosely with foil to keep warm; set aside.
	3. Reduce heat to medium. Add garlic and rosemary to skillet; cook, stirring, for 30 to 60 seconds or until fragrant. Pour in beef broth and red wine; bring to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3 to 5 minutes or until reduced by half. Stir in cranberry sauce. Reduce heat to low. 
	4. Add butter, one cube at a time, stirring or swirling skillet to allow each piece to dissolve before adding the next. Move skillet back and forth from heat, for about 2 to 3 minutes or as needed, to dissolve butter to a creamy consistency. 
	5. Serve sauce over steaks. Sprinkle with parsley. 
Recipe Tips:
  - The secret to this luscious sauce is the cold butter. Using cold butter to finish a pan sauce adds body and sheen, and is a classic French technique called mounting. There are a few key elements needed for success; the butter must be cold and the heat cannot be too high or the sauce will separate. Be sure that each piece of butter is fully incorporated before adding the next piece. If the sauce is getting too hot, just remove from the heat for a few seconds before adding the next butter cube.

	- 2-inch (5 cm) piece gingerroot
	- 1 orange
	- 1 green onion
	- Teriyaki sauce
	- Asian chili sauce
Recipe Methods:
	1. Combine gingerroot, orange zest and juice, green onion, teriyaki sauce and chili sauce in a sealable freezer bag. Pierce short ribs all over with a fork. Add ribs to bag, massaging to coat; seal and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.
	2. Discard marinade from ribs. Pat ribs dry with paper towel. Grill in a closed preheated barbecue over medium-high heat (400°F/200°C) for 8 to 10 minutes, turning twice or more or until cooked to medium-rare doneness (145°F/63°C) at the most.

	3. Grill steaks in a closed preheated barbecue over medium-high heat (400°F/200°C) for 6 to 8 minutes for ½ to ¾ inch (1 to 2 cm) thick steaks, turning twice or more, or until a digital instant-read thermometer inserted sideways into centre of steak reads 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare doneness at the least.
	4. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes before serving. Carve across the grain into slices and serve with Fresh Tomato Salad.
Recipe Tips:
  - The trick of basting the surface of the steaks with oil before salting prevents the salt from dissolving into the meat, which is why you can salt generously. The salt on the surface helps to create a bit of a crust on the outside.

Recipe Title: Dijon-Crusted Oven Roast with Shallot Gravy
Recipe Summary: This restaurant-style roast beef gets rave reviews like this one: “The roast was perfect! It was delicious. And the thermometer – what a difference! The meat cooked PERFECTLY! No guessing. No opening the oven. No stressing. The whole meal was delish!” The shape of the roast has as much to do with the cook time as the size and the cut. Our time-test results are based on a 3-rib roast that was about 7-in (18 cm) long x 6-in (15 cm) wide x 3-in (8 cm) deep. NOTE: ‘Time-to-cook’ figures are rough guidelines only as cook time is dependent on so many factors such as: oven and thermometer accuracy, starting temperature of roast, roast shape and cut. A good thermometer is one of your best kitchen investments.

	- White vinegar
	- Dijon mustard
	- Prepared horseradish
	- All-purpose flour 
	- Baking powder
	- Kosher salt
	- Pepper
	- Eggs
Recipe Methods:
	1. Dough: Whisk together flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together oil, warm water, egg and vinegar in a medium bowl or measuring cup. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and pour in the liquid ingredients. Stir to combine until a ball of dough forms. Transfer dough to a clean work surface and knead for 1 to 2 minutes or until flour is evenly incorporated.&nbsp;Return dough to the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour. 
	2. Filling: Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil over medium heat in a skillet. Add onion and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes or until wilted. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring often, for about 30 minutes or until very soft and caramelized. Let cool.
	3. Meanwhile, place potato in a saucepan and add cold water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat. Season water with salt. Reduce heat and boil gently for about 15 minutes or until soft. Drain and return to pot. Mash until smooth. Let cool.
	4. Whisk together egg and egg yolk in a large bowl. Add caramelized onion, mashed potato, remaining oil, corned beef, thyme and stir until combined. Cover and refrigerate until cool.
	5. Divide dough in half; keep one half covered with plastic wrap. Roll out half of dough into a large rectangle, about ⅛ inch thick and between 12 and 15 inches (30 and 38 cm) on the long side. 
	6. Spoon half of the filling onto the dough, 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) from the long edge closest to you, and shaping it into a 3-inch (7.5 cm) wide log. Lift the long edge of dough closest to you over the filling, then carefully roll up into a cylinder, enclosing the filling. Arrange so the seam is on the bottom and adjust roll if needed so that filling is evenly distributed. 
	7. Trim ends of the dough so it is even with the filling. Using the dull side of a knife, make a light indentation every 2 to 2½ inches (5 to 6 cm) so that your cylinder is divided into 6 equal-sized pieces. Cut through each knish with the sharp side the knife to make 6 log-shaped rolls.
	8. To shape knish, gently press the filling inward on one end of the log with your finger, then stretch the dough over the filling and pinch to seal. Place the pinched end (now the bottom) onto work surface. For the top, use your thumbs and pointer fingers to pinch two opposite sides of the cut edges of dough in towards the center, so there is a slight indent and some filling showing. Place knishes on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, spacing them apart. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
	9. Egg wash: Whisk egg with 1 tsp (5 mL) water in a small bowl. Brush over knishes and season with salt. 
	10. Bake in preheated 375°F oven for 35 to 40 minutes, rotating pan halfway through, until golden. Let cool on a wire rack.
	11. Mustard and Horseradish Sauce: Combine garlic, mustard, lemon juice, horseradish and egg yolks in a small food processor or in a tall cup using an immersion blender. Purée, slowly drizzling in oil to make a thin emulsion. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl and stir in chives. Cover and refrigerate until serving, for up to 1 day.
	12. Herb Salad: Combine parsley, dill, and arugula in a bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and lemon juice and toss to combine.
	13. Slice each knish in half crosswise and serve on a platter along with Mustard and Horseradish Sauce and Herb Salad alongside.
Recipe Tips:
  - To cook Corned Beef Brisket: remove Corned Beef Brisket from packaging and place in a Dutch oven or enamelled cast-iron roaster; add enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer on the stovetop or transfer to a preheated 325°F oven, and cook for 2½ to 3 hours, adding more water if necessary, until beef is fork-tender. Drain and slice thickly across the grain, then tear into shreds for this recipe, or slice to serve. Wrap and refrigerate cooked corned beef for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months. To roast garlic: Cut top ¼ inch (5 mm) off top of garlic heads. Place heads upright on a square of foil; drizzle with sunflower or olive oil and bundle up foil to enclose garlic. Bake in preheated 400°F oven for about 45 minutes or until garlic is very soft. Let cool, then squeeze garlic cloves out of skins.

Recipe Shopping List:
	- ½ lb (250 g) bacon
	- Onion
	- Stalk celery
	- 3 cloves garlic
	- Fresh rosemary
	- Roasted chestnuts (or toasted broken pecans)
	- 5 oz (150 g) spinach
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper

	- Fresh rosemary
	- 6 cloves garlic
	- Brandy
	- Reduced-sodium beef broth
	- 4 sprigs fresh thyme
	- 1 bay leaf
	- Cornstarch
	- Fresh chives
Recipe Methods:
	1. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook bacon for 7 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crisp around the edges. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Add onion, celery, garlic and rosemary to skillet. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until tender. Add chestnuts, spinach, salt and pepper; cook, stirring, for 3 to 5 minutes or until spinach is wilted. Remove from heat and let cool completely. Transfer spinach mixture to a large bowl; add cooked bacon, bread crumbs and egg and toss to combine. Set aside. 
	2. Using a long sharp knife, starting at the narrow side of the roast, cut the meat along the rack of ribs to separate roast from the bones, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of meat still attached to the bones at the opposite end for a “hinge” so it can open like a book. Place the roast on a flat work surface with bones down, and lift up meaty portion to open like a book. Spread the stuffing over the side with the bones, using hands to pack stuffing neatly; move the meaty portion of the roast back into position over the bones, topping the stuffing, like closing the book. Tie roast together, in 4 places, with butcher’s twine to keep the stuffing inside. 
	Mustard Rub: : 
		3. Combine mustard, rosemary, garlic, salt and pepper; rub all over roast. Place tied roast, bones down, on rack in shallow roasting pan. Insert oven-safe meat thermometer sideways into centre of roast avoiding fat, bones and stuffing. Oven-sear in preheated 450°F oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 275°F; roast, uncovered, for about 4¼ to 4½ hours for medium-rare, removing from oven when 5°F (3°C) below desired finished temperature (145°F/63°C for medium-rare, 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done). 
		4. Transfer roast to cutting board, cover with foil and let rest for 15 minutes before carving. 
	Brandy Pan Sauce: : 
		5. Meanwhile, drain off fat and remove any pieces of scorched stuffing from drippings; discard both. Heat pan drippings in the roasting pan over medium-high heat. Add brandy, stirring and scraping up any browned bits from pan. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until reduced by half. Stir in broth, thyme and bay leaf; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 7 minutes until flavours blend. Combine cornstarch with 2 tbsp (30 mL) cold water; gradually whisk into pan sauce and simmer, whisking, for 2 to 3 minutes or until thickened and glossy. Season with salt and pepper. Strain into gravy boat and discard solids. Stir in chives; keep warm. 
		6. To serve, cut twine from roast and discard. Spoon stuffing into a bowl and keep warm. Cut meat from the bone at the hinge to remove meaty portion completely from the bones. Carve meaty portion of the roast across the grain into slices. Serve with stuffing and Brandy Pan Sauce. Cut between bones into individual ribs and serve on the side, if desired.
Recipe Tips:
  - To make bread crumbs, pulse day-old bread in a food processor until coarse bread crumbs are achieved. Store in an airtight sealable bag and freeze for up to 3 months.

	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) rock, cane or palm sugar (approx)
	- Garnish (optional): Thin slices white onion, sliced chili peppers, fresh cilantro leaves
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 2 large onions
	- 5 oz (150 g) piece fresh gingerroot
	- Vegetable oil 
	- 8 lb (3.5 kg)  Beef Soup Bones, 2- to 3-inch (5 to 7.5 cm) pieces
	- 2 lb (1 kg) Boneless Beef Digital Flexor Meat or Hind Shank (Bubble Meat) 
	- 6 whole star anise 
	- 6 whole cloves
	- 2 Chinese black cardamom pods (tsao ko)
	- 2-inch (5 cm) piece cinnamon stick
	- Coriander seeds
	- Salt
	- Fish sauce
	- Rock, cane or palm sugar
	- Garnish (optional): Thin slices white onion, sliced chili peppers, fresh cilantro leaves
Recipe Methods:
	1. Position oven rack approximately 5 inches (12.5 cm) away from the broiling element and preheat broiler to high. Quarter onions and slice gingerroot in half lengthwise. Arrange cut-side up on a large foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and brush lightly with oil. Broil for 10 to 12 minutes until deeply browned and almost black. Let cool. Do not remove the blackened areas.
	2. Meanwhile, combine beef bones and meat in a 12-quart (12 L) stockpot. Add cold water to cover by 2 inches (5 cm). Bring to a boil over high heat; boil, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Drain and discard the water. 
	3. Meanwhile, combine star anise, cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick and coriander seeds in a small skillet. Toast over medium heat, shaking pan constantly, for about 2 minutes or until fragrant. Transfer to a plate to cool. Enclose the spices in cheesecloth bundle, a tea filter bag or spice infuser, if desired. Set aside.
	4. Rinse the bones and meat under cool water, carefully removing any scum clinging to the bones. Wash out the pot and return the bones to the pot. Add 8 quarts (8 L) water and return to a boil over high heat. Remove any scum that rises to the surface with a large spoon, then turn down to a simmer. Add the charred onions, ginger, spice bundle (or loose spices) and 1 tbsp (15 mL) salt. Gently simmer for 2 to 3 hours, until meat is tender (timing will depend on the cut used). 
	5. Remove the meat from broth with a slotted spoon and place in a bowl of cold water to prevent it from darkening. Continue simmering the broth for 6 to 9 hours longer, maintaining a water level of 3 inches (7.5 cm) above the bones by adding water as needed, until flavour is developed. When meat is cool, remove from the water, cover and refrigerate until serving.
	6. Drain the broth through a colander or large sieve into a large bowl or another pot, pressing down on the solids. Discard solids. There should be 6 quarts (6 L) broth; either add more water or reduce the broth over medium-low heat to reach that amount.
	7. Return the broth to the pot and season it with fish sauce, salt and sugar, adding more to taste. Skim off the fat, as desired. Thinly slice the reserved meat and add it to the soup and reheat to serve. Garnish with onion, chili peppers and cilantro, as desired.
Recipe Tips:
  - If you’re not using the broth for soup immediately, store the meat separately and let broth cool, then store in airtight containers in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 6 months.

	- 3 cloves garlic
	- Gingerroot
	- Ground cumin
	- Coriander
	- Thai red curry paste

	- Thai basil leaves
	- Fresh lime juice
	- Lime wedges
	- Hot cooked jasmine rice
	- Thin slices Thai chili peppers (optional)
	- Chopped peanuts (optional)
Recipe Methods:
	1. Pat short ribs dry with paper towel. Season all over with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil over medium-high heat in a Dutch oven or enamelled cast-iron roaster; brown short ribs, in batches and adding more oil as needed, until browned on all sides. Transfer ribs to a plate.
	2. Reduce heat to medium and add any remaining oil to pot. Add shallots, garlic, gingerroot, cumin and coriander; cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes or until shallots are starting to soften. Stir in curry paste; cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes or until fragrant. Add 1½ cups (375 mL) water, coconut milk, peanut butter, soy sauce, sugar and fish sauce. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits from pan. Return ribs and any accumulated juices to the pan. 
	3. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 1½ hours. Stir in carrots and red pepper; simmer, adding additional water if needed to keep beef covered while braising, for about 30 to 40 minutes or until beef and vegetable are fork-tender. Remove from heat.
	4. Transfer beef to a bowl with a slotted spoon; cover to keep warm.
	5. Skim any fat from sauce and discard. Stir broccoli into sauce and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer for about 3 minutes or until broccoli is crisp-tender. Stir in half the basil and the lime juice. 
	6. Divide rice evenly among shallow serving bowls. Top each serving with a short rib; ladle vegetables and sauce over top. Garnish with remaining basil and chili peppers and peanuts, as desired, and serve with lime wedges.
Recipe Tips:
  - Thai basil leaves feature savoury anise notes and are sturdier in texture than Italian basil leaves, however either basil will work well in this recipe. If using Italian basil, halve the amount and substitute the remaining half with fresh mint leaves for more aromatic flavours. The flavours of the braise will blend nicely when made ahead, so will taste even better made, refrigerated overnight and served the next day. To make ahead, prepare through step 3, let cool to room temperature, cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Before serving, skim fat from surface, then gently reheat short ribs in sauce over medium heat until sauce is simmering and beef is heated through, then proceed with step 4.

Recipe Methods:
	1. Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling water for 2 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold running water; drain well and set aside.
	2. Whisk cornstarch into ¼ cup (60 mL) water; whisk in soy sauce and oyster sauce. Set aside.
	3. Heat 2 tbsp (30 mL) of the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add noodles and pan-fry, without stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes or until crisp on the bottom. Turn over and pan-fry, without stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes, until crisp and slightly browned. (Note: the centre of the noodles can remain soft, if desired.). Transfer to a serving platter and set aside. 
	4. Pat beef strips dry with paper towel and season all over with salt and pepper. Return pan to medium-high heat and add remaining oil.

Recipe Tips:
  - Chili crisp (or chili oil) is a Chinese condiment now available in jars at specialty grocery stores and well-stocked supermarkets and adds an umami kick to the chow mein. Chef Lui recommends Ho Mei brand Crazy Rich Chili. You can also use for your favourite hot sauce for some heat, you just won’t get the umami punch.

Recipe Title: Oven Roast Beef with Rosemary Mushroom Sauce
Recipe Summary: The grainy mustard adds both texture and flavour to the outer crust of this roast recipe. These time-test results are based on a roast that was about 7½-in (19 cm) long x 3¾-in (9.5 cm wide) x 4¾-in (12 cm) deep. NOTE: ‘Time-to-cook’ figures are rough guidelines only as cook time is dependent on so many factors such as oven and thermometer accuracy, starting temperature of roast, roast shape and cut. A good thermometer is one of your best kitchen investments.

	5. On a large cutting board, slice the onion lengthwise into thin wedges and carve the steak across the grain into thin 2-inch (5 cm) long slices (like shaved roast beef); season steak and onion all over with salt and pepper to taste. Divide onion and steak slices equally among four toast slices on top of the cheese. Top each with remaining toast with melted cheese on fillings to make 4 sandwiches. Serve each sandwich with a knife and fork.
Recipe Tips:

Recipe Methods:
	1. Make your own Furlani Garlic Texas Toast bread crumbs: Cut 1 slice of Furlani Texas toast into ½-inch (1 cm) cubes. Arrange in a single layer on parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Bake in preheated 350°F oven, stirring twice or more, for 18 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy all the way through. Cool to room temperature. Fold parchment paper over cubes and crush into crumbs using the bottom of a skillet or palm of your hand. Set aside.
	2. Meanwhile, heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook onion, stirring often, for about 5 minutes or until softened. Transfer half of the cooked onion to a large bowl. Set the pan with remaining onion aside for the sauce.  
	3. Stir Worcestershire sauce, 2 tbsp (30 mL) of the pasta sauce, oregano, salt and pepper into onion in large bowl. Add the reserved Furlani Garlic Texas Toast bread crumbs to the bowl along with the egg and ground beef. Mix together thoroughly but gently. Form into about thirty 1-inch (2.5 cm) balls. Arrange on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet, spacing them apart.

Add mushrooms and cook, stirring often, for about 5 to 8 minutes or until mushrooms are starting to brown. Add a splash of wine (if using) and cook 1 minute or until evaporated. Stir in the remaining pasta sauce, stewed tomatoes and Parmesan rind (if using); bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Stir in the meatballs and heat through.
	6. Meanwhile cook the pasta and heat the desired number of Furlani Garlic Texas Toast slices according to package directions. Drain pasta well.
	 7. Serve pasta topped with meatballs and sauce, along with Furlani Garlic Texas Toast. Top each serving with some grated Parmesan (if using).
Recipe Tips:
  - Instead of oven-baking the meatballs, you can poach them in the sauce to cook: Add raw meatballs to the simmering sauce, gently stir and return to a strong simmer. Cover the pot and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring gently halfway through, until a digital instant read thermometer inserted into the centre of several meatballs reads 160°F (71°C).

Recipe Methods:
	1. Combine beef, potatoes, mushrooms, carrot, onion and celery in a 3½- to 6-qt (3.5 to 6 L) slow cooker. Whisk together broth, tomato paste, rosemary, flour, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt and pepper in a measuring cup or bowl; pour over meat and vegetables. Add bay leaves; stir to combine. 
	2. Cover and cook on LOW for 8 to 10 hours or on HIGH for 4 to 6 hours or until beef is fork-tender and sauce is thickened and bubbling. Transfer to a deep 9-inch (25 cm) square baking dish. Stir in peas and let cool slightly. Cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days. 
	3. To serve, roll out and/or trim pastry to fit over baking dish or pie plate, allowing for a 1-inch (2.5 cm) overhang. Drape pastry over filling and crimp edges around edge of baking dish.
	4. Brush cream over pastry. Cut a few steam vents in centre of pastry. Bake in preheated 425°F oven to for 30 to 35 minutes or until pastry is golden brown and filling is heated through and bubbling. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving. 
Recipe Tips:
  - For individual pot pies, divide filling among 4 individual 2-cup (500 mL) baking dishes or ramekins. Place puff pastry on lightly floured surface and cut into 4 equal squares. Top each mini pot pie with a pastry square, trimming and crimping to fit if necessary. Brush pastry with cream and cut a steam vent in centre of each pie. Reduce baking time to 20 to 25 minutes or until pastry is golden brown and filling is heated through and bubbling. For freezer mini pot pies, prepare as above for individual pies, freezing before baking. Wrap pot pies in baking dishes in plastic wrap, then overwrap in foil and freeze for up to 1 month. Bake from frozen. Uncover and place baking dishes in cold oven then set oven to 400°F (200°C). Bake for about 45 to 50 minutes or until pastry is golden brown and filling is heated through and bubbling. It is important that dishes go into a cold oven and gradually warm as the oven heats to prevent the dish from cracking.

	- 2 tsp (10 mL) EACH salt, dried oregano leaves and dry mustard
	- 2 tsp (10 mL) EACH garlic powder and onion powder
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) sweet smoked paprika
	- 1 rack Beef Grilling Back Ribs (about 5 lb/2.2 kg)
	- Lime wedges 
Recipe Shopping List:
	- Packed brown sugar
	- Chili powder
	- Finely ground coffee
	- Cracked peppercorns
	- Salt
	- Dried oregano leaves
	- Dry mustard
	- Garlic powder
	- Onion powder
	- Sweet smoked paprika
	- 1 rack Beef Grilling Back Ribs  (about 5 lb/2.2 kg)
	- Lime wedges 
Recipe Methods:
	1. Combine sugar, chili powder, coffee, peppercorns, salt, oregano, mustard, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika in a small bowl. 
	2. Place ribs on a large foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and rub all over with spice mixture. Fold foil over or over-wrap with another sheet of foil and seal edges to make a foil pouch. Roast in preheated 250°F oven for 3 to 3½ hours until meat is fork tender.
	3. Carefully unwrap ribs and set on a large cutting board. Drain liquid from foil into a small saucepan. Return ribs to baking sheet; set aside. 
	4. Boil liquid over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 8 minutes until reduced to a glaze, about the consistency of maple syrup. 
	5. Broil ribs on middle rack, or remove from baking sheet and grill in a closed preheated barbecue over medium heat (350°F/180°C), for 5 to 10 minutes, turning occasionally while brushing generously all over with the glaze, until hot, browned and well-glazed.
	6. Transfer to a cutting board. Cut rack into individual ribs. Serve on a platter with lime wedges.
Recipe Tips:
  - Removing the silverskin from the rack before rubbing with the spice mixture allows the flavours to penetrate the meat better, and enhances tenderness. To remove it from the rack, slide a thin knife between the meat and the membrane, pull up until there is enough to grab hold of with a paper towel. Like removing wallpaper, pull it off with even pressure to remove as one large sheet.

	- 3 tbsp (45 mL) crumbled blue cheese
	- 3 tbsp (45 mL) softened butter
	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) chopped fresh parsley
	- 2 lb (1 kg) piece Beef Heart 
	- 6 large cloves garlic, peeled 
	- 3 medium shallots, peeled
	- Vegetable oil
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper 
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 3 tbsp (45 mL) crumbled blue cheese
	- Softened butter
	- Fresh parsley
	- 2 lb (1 kg) piece  Beef Heart 
	- 6 large cloves garlic
	- 3 medium shallots
	- Vegetable oil
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper 
Recipe Methods:
	1. Mash blue cheese, butter and parsley together in a small bowl. Form into a 4-inch (10 cm) log, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours, or for up to 3 days.
	2. Rinse heart under cold water. Trim off fat, membranes and any fibrous tissue from the heart. Cut into 4 equal, steak-like pieces.
	3. Thinly slice the garlic cloves crosswise into 1/16-inch (2 mm) thick slices using a very sharp knife or mandoline (with caution). Repeat with shallots, keeping separate from garlic; separate the rings of shallots.
	4. Heat 1 inch (2.5 cm) of oil over medium-low heat in a small, heavy skillet. Add sliced garlic and cook, stirring occasionally and watching carefully, for about 4 to 5 minutes or until pale gold. Strain through a sieve into a heatproof bowl, saving the oil. Place the chips on a paper towel-lined plate to cool.
	 5. Return the oil to the skillet and reheat over medium-low heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring occasionally and watching carefully, for about 5 to 6 minutes or until the shallots are a shade past golden brown. Strain through a sieve into the same heatproof bowl. (Save the oil to use in salads and marinades.) Place the shallots on another paper towel-lined plate to cool.
	6. Season the heart with salt and pepper to your taste. Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil over high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Add the heart and cook for 4 to 6 minutes, turning twice or more, until a digital instant-read thermometer inserted sideways into steaks reads 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare at the most. Transfer to 4 heated plates. 
	7. Cut the blue cheese butter into 8 slices. Place 2 pieces on each piece of heart. Pile the shallots evenly on top then sprinkle with the garlic chips. Serve immediately.

		3. Heat vegetable oil in heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of the shallots and cook, stirring constantly, for 6 to 7 minutes or until just golden. Remove using slotted spoon to paper-towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining shallots. (Make ahead: store refrigerated for up to one week in air tight container.)
		4. Transfer roast on cutting board, cover with foil and let rest for at least 15 minutes. 
		5. While roast rests, bake Yorkie Puddings: Pour off all but 2 tbsp (30 mL) fat from roasting pan into a liquid measuring cup; set roasting pan aside. Pour a bit of the reserved fat into each cup of a 12-cup muffin pan; heat the pan in 425ºF oven for 5 minutes. Divide Yorkie Pudding mixture among the muffin cups and bake for 15 to 20 minutes until golden brown. Serve immediately.
		6. Peppercorn Wine Sauce: Heat reserved fat and pan drippings in roasting pan over medium-high heat. Whisk in flour; cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in beef broth, red wine and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, stirring up any browned bits from bottom of pan; cook, whisking, for 4 minutes or until sauce is thickened. 
		7. Carve roast across the grain into thin slices and serve with hot Peppercorn Wine Sauce and Yorkie Puddings. Top with a few Frizzled Shallots.
Recipe Tips:
  - When buying a beef oven roast, buy 12 oz (375 g) beef per person for bone-in-roasts or for boneless roasts, buy 6 to 8 oz (175 to 250 g) beef per person.

Recipe Title: Simply-Seasoned Grilled Steak with Garlic and Herb Butter
Recipe Summary: Much like topping a finished steak with a traditional compound butter, this perfectly grilled steak gets finished with a fresh herb butter without the bother of making and chilling the butter in advance of serving. This technique of smearing the seasoned butter on the cutting board allows the hot steak to become coated in the herb butter as it rests before carving. This steak is also known as a Porterhouse Grilling Steak and it has the same type of bone you find in a T-bone Steak.

	- 2 green onions, finely chopped
	- Fresh ground pepper
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1½ lb (750 g)  Beef Outside Round Marinating Steak, ¾ inch (2 cm) thick  
	- Chive and garlic flavoured spreadable cream cheese (such as Boursin)
	- 4 oz (125 g) thinly sliced smoked salmon
	- Green onions
	- Fresh ground pepper
Recipe Methods:
	1. Pound one side of the steak with a jagged side of the meat mallet until about ¼ inch (5 mm) thick. Spread pounded side of steak with cream cheese to within ¼ inch (5 mm) of edge. Sprinkle with green onions and pepper to your taste. Cover completely with smoked salmon slices in a single layer, overlapping edges of salmon as necessary. Starting with a long side, roll up like jelly roll. Tie tightly in 1-inch (2.5 cm) intervals with soaked butcher’s twine to secure, or hold together with metal skewers. 
	2. Grill in a closed preheated barbecue over medium-high heat (400°F/200°C) for 30 to 35 minutes, turning about every 8 minutes to brown all sides, or until a digital instant-read thermometer inserted in centre of roll reads 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare at the least (or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done). 
	3. Transfer to cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. Place seam-side-down, remove twine or skewers and carve crosswise into ½-inch (1 cm) thick slices. 
Recipe Tips:
  - Be sure to let roulades rest for about 5 minutes after cooking so that the juices get the chance to settle before you serve or slice.

Recipe Ingredients List:
	- Wood chips, soaked according to package directions 
	- 1½ lb (750 g) Beef Rib Finger Meat(about 8 pieces)
	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) EACH chili powder and sweet paprika
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) EACH freshly ground pepper, packed brown sugar, finely ground coffee and ground cumin
	- ½ tsp (2 mL) EACH salt and garlic powder
	- ¼ tsp (1 mL) EACH cayenne pepper and ground cloves
	- ⅓ cup (75 mL) barbecue sauce
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) maple syrup
	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) grainy Dijon mustard
Recipe Shopping List:
	- Wood chips, soaked according to package directions 
	- 1½ lb (750 g) Beef Rib Finger Meat(about 8 pieces)
	- Chili powder
	- Sweet paprika
	- Freshly ground pepper
	- Packed brown sugar
	- Finely ground coffee
	- Ground cumin
	- Salt
	- Garlic powder
	- Cayenne pepper
	- Ground cloves
	- Barbecue sauce
	- Maple syrup
	- Grainy Dijon mustard
Recipe Methods:
	1. Fill drip pan with water and place under grill (off to one side). Preheat barbecue to medium-high (400°F/200°C). Turn off burner under drip pan. 
	2. Add soaked wood chips to smoker box. Alternatively, wrap 2 cups (5 oz/150 g) wood chips loosely in foil to create a small pouch, punching a few holes at the top of the pouch to let the smoke out. Place smoker box or pouch on the grill grate above the burner that is turned on for 10 to 20 minutes, or until starting to smoke.
	3. Meanwhile, trim excess fat from the meat to your taste. Starting at the thicker end of each piece of meat, make a cut in between the meat and the fibrous silverskin, lifting the fat and silverskin away from the meat while you trim along the strip of meat. (Tip: Grip the silverskin with a paper towel to prevent slipping.). Discard the trim. Place meat in a large bowl.
	4. Combine chili powder, paprika, pepper, sugar, coffee, cumin, salt, garlic powder, cayenne and cloves in a small bowl. Sprinkle spice blend over meat and toss until evenly coated.
	 5. When wood chips start to smoke, place meat on grill over drip pan (off the heat). Close lid and cook for about 2 hours or until fork-tender.
	6. Meanwhile, combine barbecue sauce, maple syrup and mustard in a small bowl; set aside for basting.
	7. Move meat to grill that is over the burner that is turned on. Cook for 6 to 8 minutes, basting with reserved sauce and turning as needed, or until lightly charred and caramelized. 
Recipe Tips:
  - Substitute the homemade seasoning blend with about 3 tbsp (45 mL) of your favourite store-bought spice blend, such as barbecue, chipotle or Tex-Mex. The fibrous silverskin on finger meat is tough. Removing it before cooking makes the meat much more tender. Double the recipe to serve a hungry crowd. Substitute finely ground coffee with instant coffee or espresso powder.

	- 3 bay leaves
	- 1 head garlic, papery outer skin removed
Recipe Shopping List:
	- Medium-grain rice, such as jasmine
	- 1½ lb (750 g)  Beef Rib Finger Meat 
	- Salt
	- Vegetable oil
	- Onion
	- Carrots
	- Ground cumin
	- Sweet paprika
	- Ground coriander
	- Fresh ground pepper
	- 3 bay leaves
	- 1 head garlic
Recipe Methods:
	1. Place rice in a large bowl and cover with cold water. Swish it around with your hand 3 to 4 times then pour off the water. Repeat 3 to 4 times or until the water runs clear. Cover again with cold water and let stand for 30 minutes while you prepare the rest of the ingredients. Drain through a sieve and reserve.
	2. Trim excess fat from the meat to your taste. Starting at the thicker end of each piece of meat, make a cut in between the meat and the fibrous silverskin, lifting the fat and silverskin away from the meat while you trim along the strip of meat. (Tip: Grip the silverskin with a paper towel to prevent slipping.). Discard the trim. Cut the meat crosswise into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces. 
	3. Season the beef all over with 1 tsp (5 mL) salt. Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil over high heat in a large Dutch oven or deep enamelled cast-iron roaster. Add half the beef and, cook, turning, until browned on all sides. Transfer to a plate. Add 1 tbsp (15 mL) more oil and brown remaining beef. Transfer to plate. 
	4. Reduce heat to medium heat and add the remaining 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil to the pot. Cook onions, stirring frequently for about 5 minutes until onions start to brown. Add cumin, paprika, coriander and pepper; cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Return the beef and any accumulated juices to the pot, stirring to coat with onions and spices. Add 2 cups (500 mL) water, bay leaves and head of garlic. Stir well and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat and simmer for 1½ hours or until beef is tender. Add a splash of water if the liquid is reducing too quickly and lower the heat. The liquid should be reduced by half at the end of cooking. 
	5. Set garlic aside. Arrange carrots in a layer over beef mixture. Add rice to the pot, leveling it with the back of a spoon. Stir remaining 1½ tsp (7 mL) salt into 1 cup (250 mL) water; pour over rice. Add enough additional water (about 2 to 3 cups/500 to 750 mL) to cover the rice by ½ inch (1 cm). Place the whole head of garlic on the rice, root end pointing down. Bring to a boil over high heat.
	6. Reduce heat to medium and boil, uncovered, until the water reaches the level of the rice and bubbles are breaking over the surface of the rice. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes until all the water is absorbed and the rice is tender. Remove from heat and let rest for 10 minutes. Remove the garlic. Fold rice and beef mixture gently to distribute the ingredients and transfer to a large serving dish. Discard bay leaves. Place the garlic head on top as a garnish. The garlic is meant to be shared and squeezed from the peel to eat with the pilaf.
Recipe Tips:
  - To save time, you can use an electric pressure cooker to cook the beef then finish the dish on top of the stove. Brown the beef then transfer to the pressure cooker. Follow Step 3 for cooking the onions and spices and add to the pressure cooker. Add 2 cups (500 mL) water. Seal the electric pressure cooker lid and make sure the vent is closed. Set the pressure to High and time for 20 minutes. Quick release pressure, then transfer the mixture to a pot on top of the stove. Continue with Step 4.

Recipe Ingredients List:
	- 12 Beef Eye of Round Fast-fry Steaks, each 6 inches (15 cm) long (about 1½ lb/750 g total)
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) EACH salt and fresh ground pepper
	- 1½ cups (375 mL) all-purpose flour
	- ¾ cup (175 mL) milk
	- 2 eggs, beaten
	- ½ cup (125 mL) vegetable oil, divided (approx)
	- Gravy
		- ¼ cup (60 mL) butter
		- ¼ cup (60 mL) all-purpose flour
		- 3 cups (750 mL) milk
		- ½ tsp (2 mL) salt
		- Fresh ground pepper
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 12 Beef Eye of Round Fast-fry Steaks, each 6-inches (8 cm) long (about 1½ lb/750 g total)
	- Vegetable oil
	- Salt
	- Pepper
	- All-purpose flour
	- Eggs
	- Butter
	- 3¾ cups (925 mL) milk
Recipe Methods:
	1. Pat steaks dry with paper towel; season all over with salt and pepper. Place flour in a shallow bowl. Whisk milk with eggs in a separate shallow bowl. Working with one slice at a time, coat steak in flour, dip in milk mixture and then return to flour. Coat steak completely with flour; pressing firmly yet carefully, so that the coating adheres to the meat. Arrange steaks in a single layer on a large baking sheet.&nbsp;
	2. Heat half the oil over medium-high heat in large nonstick skillet; cook steaks, in batches, for 4 minutes, turning once, until meat is cooked to medium (160ºF/71ºF), coating is golden brown and meat is still pink inside. Transfer to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and keep warm in preheated 250ºF oven. Add more oil to skillet as needed between batches. (If steaks begin to brown too quickly, reduce heat slightly or if steaks are not sizzling when added to the pan, increase heat.)&nbsp;
	3. Gravy: Discard any remaining oil from skillet. Wipe skillet with paper towel to remove any overly browned bits. Melt butter over medium heat in skillet. Sprinkle in flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes or until a lightly browned paste forms. Pour in about ½ cup (125 mL) of the milk, whisking constantly, until mixture is smooth. Whisk in remaining milk; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and boil gently, stirring occasionally, for about 3 to 5 minutes or until sauce has thickened to gravy consistency. Season with salt and ½ tsp (2 mL) pepper.&nbsp;
	4. Serve sauce over steaks and finish with additional pepper, if desired.
Recipe Tips:
  - Avoid crowding the pan during the frying to ensure an evenly golden coating and don’t layer the cooked steaks on top of each other, as this will cause the coating to steam and become soggy. You can elevate the cream sauce by adding a splash of white wine and up to 1 tsp (5 mL) dried thyme or crumbled sage leaves before whisking in the milk.

Recipe Title: Swedish Meatballs
Recipe Summary: The fresh bread crumbs are easy to make with any stale bread and when soaked in the milk, become the secret to tender juicy meatballs – the panade. Meatballs are browned and cooked in the skillet before adding to the simmering cream sauce so they have good colour and flavour but don’t discolour the sauce. Stir in the sour cream just at the end so the cream sauce does not curdle or break. Serve over cooked potatoes or with buttered egg noodles. This recipe was adapted from Chef Alexandra Feswick’s original and modified, as necessary, for home cooks.

	1. Sauce: Melt butter over medium heat in a saucepan. Add flour and cook, stirring, for about 4 minutes or until bubbling, but not browned. Whisk in warm beef broth until blended and smooth. Gradually whisk in cream and bring to a gently boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or until thick. Remove from heat and set aside.
	2. Meatballs: Meanwhile, heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) of the oil over medium heat in a nonstick skillet. Cook onions, stirring, for about 5 minutes or until soft. Transfer to a large bowl and let cool slightly. (Reserve skillet.)
	3. Combine bread crumbs and milk in a small bowl; let soak for 5 to 10 minutes.

	8. Serve garnished with dill and green onions.
Recipe Tips:
  - To make fresh bread crumbs, grate about 1 slice of bread or a bun using the large holes of a box-style cheese grater (freeze the bread for 15 minutes to firm it up for easier grating) or simply tear the bread into very small pieces; measure ½ cup (125 mL) for this recipe. You can freeze any extra for another use.

Recipe Title: Braised Provençal-Style Beef
Recipe Summary: Simmering steaks are a great start to making comforting stews, since the cutting into meat into cubes is already half-done for you! Cutting onion lengthwise for braised dishes like this one helps the onion keep its shape and texture even with a lengthy cook-time. If you don’t have herbes de Provence, make your own blend with an equal mix of dried thyme, oregano, marjoram, savoury and/or rosemary leaves – crush the herbs in your hand to help release their flavours. You can add a touch of lavender too if you have it on hand and don’t worry if you don’t have each and every herb in the mix.

	- Limes
	- 2½ lb (1.3 kg)  Beef Strip Loin Oven Roast  (untied)

Recipe Methods:
	1. Set up water bath for sous vide and preheat to 130°F (54.5°C) for medium-rare or 140°F (60°C) for medium according to manufacturer’s directions.
	2. Combine chili powder, chipotle powder, ½ tsp (2 mL) salt, lemon zest and lime zest in a small bowl. Pat beef dry with paper towel and rub all over with chili powder mixture. Place in a large bag for sous vide (vacuum, sealable freezer or reusable silicone). Remove as much air as possible and vacuum or manually seal. 
	3. Immerse bag in preheated water bath and secure it to the side of the pot with a clip, keeping the top of the bag above the surface of the water. Cover water bath with foil or plastic to reduce evaporation. Cook sous vide for 6 hours, replenishing water as necessary.
	 4. Remove beef from water bath. Remove beef from bag, discarding liquid. Gently pat roast dry with paper towel (trying not to remove seasoning) and season all over with salt to your taste. 
	5. Heat oil in a large cast-iron or heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Sear roast in hot skillet, turning with tongs, for about 6 to 8 minutes or until browned on all sides. Transfer to cutting board. Carve across the grain into thin slices and serve on warmed plates with lime wedges to squeeze over beef.
Recipe Tips:
  - When purchasing the roast, be sure it is an appropriate size to fit into the bag you plan to use for sous vide cooking. If you want to cook more portions at the same time, use 2 roasts and 2 bags and make sure the water bath is large enough for good circulation around the bags. For convenience, you can cook the roast in step 3 for up to 8 hours.

	3. Carefully unwrap ribs and set on a large cutting board. Drain off liquid and discard; return ribs to baking sheet. Brush reserved horseradish-mustard glaze over ribs. 
	4. Broil ribs on middle rack, or remove from baking sheet and grill in a closed preheated barbecue over medium heat (350°F/180°C), for 5 to 10 minutes, turning occasionally, until hot, browned and well-glazed.
	 5. Transfer to a cutting board. Cut rack into individual ribs. Serve on a platter with additional horseradish, if desired. 
Recipe Tips:
  - Removing the silverskin from the rack before brushing with the horseradish-mustard mixture allows the flavours to penetrate the meat better, and enhances tenderness. To remove it from the rack, slide a thin knife between the meat and the membrane, pull up until there is enough to grab hold of with a paper towel. Like removing wallpaper, pull it off with even pressure to remove as one large sheet.

Recipe Title: Slow Barbecue-Roasted Beef with Molasses Bourbon Sauce
Recipe Summary: Beef ribs are cut from Prime Rib so they’re rich and hearty, making them the perfect canvas for the full-flavoured Molasses Bourbon Sauce. There are many ways to prepared beef ribs and this version uses a low-n-slow cooking method to enhance the tenderness of the meat. Brush ribs generously with the sauce during the last few minutes of grilling to maximize the caramelized crusting - just be sure to watch carefully to avoid scorching. Feel free to substitute whisky or rye for the bourbon. The sauce is also delicious with grilled Strip Loin or Rib Eye steaks, brushed on in the last 2 minutes of grilling.

Recipe Title: Roasted Steak with Sun-Dried Tomato & Blue Cheese Butter
Recipe Summary: When you don’t want to barbecue outside, this oven cooking method of high temperature oven-searing and then roasting at a reduced oven temperature works well for this thick cut of steak. Using an oven-safe thermometer takes the guesswork out of trying to figure out doneness, as it lets you know the internal temperature of the steak at all times.

	- Butter
	- Cream (any type) or milk
	- Finely crumbled blue cheese
	- Oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes
	- Fresh parsley
	- Lemon (for grated lemon zest)
	- 1 clove garlic
Recipe Methods:
	1. Pat steak dry with paper towel. Season all over with salt and pepper. 
	2. Place steak on a wire rack on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Insert an oven-safe meat thermometer sideways into centre of steak, avoiding fat and bone. Oven-sear in preheated 450°F oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 275°F; roast, uncovered, for about 50 to 60 minutes for medium-rare, removing from oven when 5°F (3°C) below desired finished temperature (145°F/63°C for medium-rare, or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done). 
	3. Whipped Seasoned Butter: Meanwhile, combine butter and cream in a medium bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium-low speed until smooth. Increase speed to high and beat for 2 to 3 minutes or until fluffy and pale yellow in colour. Add cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, parsley, lemon zest, garlic, salt and pepper. Beat for 1 to 2 minutes or until well combined. 
	4. Transfer steak to a cutting board. Smear top of steak with one-third of the whipped butter. Cover loosely with foil and let rest for 15 minutes.
	5. Carve meat from the bone, then into thin slices. Arrange slices of steak on a large platter with the bone. Serve steak with remaining whipped butter on the side.
Recipe Tips:
  - For a whipped butter variation, substitute blue cheese with goat cheese and parsley with basil. For a tasty appetizer, serve leftover steak slices on toasted crostini spread with the whipped butter and garnish with arugula leaves. A Frenched Rib Steak is similar to a Tomahawk-style Steak that is cut 1-bone thick with an exposed bone. For the Frenched Rib Steak, the bone is cleaned or “Frenched” and about 4 inches (10 cm) long.

Garnish the top with paprika or finely chopped parsley leaves before serving. Sprinkle with some shredded Cheddar cheese or grated Parmesan cheese during the last 15 minutes of baking for a cheesy potato topping.

	- Fresh spinach
	- Ricotta cheese
	- Shredded mozzarella cheese
	- Grated Parmesan cheese
	- Fresh parsley (optional)
	- Fresh basil (optional)
Recipe Methods:
	1. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add ground beef and onion; cook, stirring and breaking up beef into chunks with back of a spoon, for about 8 minutes or until beef is thoroughly cooked and onion is softened. 
	2. Stir in garlic, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper and hot pepper flakes; cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in broth, pasta sauce, diced tomatoes and Parmesan rind (if using); bring to a boil. Stir in pasta (see Tip). 
	3. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until pasta is al dente and flavours are blended.
	4. Meanwhile, arrange Furlani Garlic Texas Toast slices in a single layer on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bake in preheated 425°F oven for 5 to 6 minutes, flipping slices halfway, until toasted.
	5. Discard Parmesan rind, if necessary. Stir spinach into soup. Ladle soup into bowls and spoon a dollop of ricotta cheese into each bowl and sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan. Garnish with parsley and basil, if desired, and serve with Furlani Garlic Texas Toast.
Recipe Tips:
  - The soup can be made ahead through step 3, cooled, covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days. Reheat over medium heat, stirring often, before serving then proceed with step 4. Simmering the pasta right in the soup saves using an extra pot. If you’re planning make the soup ahead it’s best to cook the pasta separately so the noodles don’t get too soft and mushy. Cook the soup as directed without adding pasta, then just before serving, cook the pasta in a pot of boiling water until al dente, drain and stir into soup with the spinach. The Parmesan rind adds a boost of flavour to the soup, but it’s not essential if you don’t have one on hand. Get recipes and more for over 70 beef cuts at the Canadian Beef Information Gateway.

Recipe Title: Cedar-Planked Smoked Beef Roast
Recipe Summary: Rubbed with a rosemary-garlic butter and grilled using indirect heat on a cedar plank, this roast gets infused with herb and subtle smoky flavours. Easy to prepare, it’s the perfect recipe for a fuss-free summer barbecue dinner. NOTE: ‘Time-to-cook’ figures are rough guidelines only as cook time is dependent on so many factors such as: barbecue and thermometer accuracy, starting temperature of roast, roast shape and cut. A good thermometer is one of your best kitchen investments. Serve roast with prepared horseradish or your favourite barbecue sauce and a selection of salads, such as potato, coleslaw or mixed greens.

Recipe Ingredients List:
	- 1 large cedar plank (or 2 if necessary, see Tip below)
	- 3 tbsp (45 mL) butter, softened
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) finely chopped fresh rosemary
	- 3 cloves garlic, minced
	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) coarse salt, such as kosher or sea salt
	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) fresh ground pepper
	- 2 lb (1 kg) Beef Tenderloin Premium Oven Roast, center cut, tied
	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) vegetable oil 
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1 large cedar plank (or 2 if necessary, see Tip below)
	- Butter
	- Fresh rosemary
	- 3 cloves garlic
	- Coarse salt, such as kosher or sea salt
	- Fresh ground pepper
	- 2 lb (1 kg) Beef Tenderloin Premium Oven Roast, center cut, tied
	- Vegetable oil
Recipe Methods:
	1. Soak cedar plank for at least 2 hours in a container with enough warm water to cover, weighing down with heavy jars to submerge.
	2. Partially fill drip pan with water and place under grill (off to one side). Preheat barbecue to medium-high heat (400˚F/200˚C). 
	3. Combine butter, rosemary, garlic, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Pat roast dry with paper towel and rub all over with butter mixture.
	4. Discard soaking liquid from plank. Heat plank in the closed preheated barbecue directly over the hot grill (not over the drip pan) for 3 to 4 minutes or until plank crackles and smokes. Using tongs, transfer plank to side of the grill with drip pan and brush top side of plank with oil.
	 5. Insert oven-safe meat thermometer into centre of roast. Place roast on plank; turn off burner under drip pan. Cook in closed barbecue, without turning, for about 1 to 1¼ hours for medium-rare, removing from grill when 5°F (3°C) below desired finished temperature (145°F/63°C for medium-rare, or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done). 
	6. Transfer roast to a cutting board, cover with foil and let rest for 15 minutes. Let plank cool completely and discard.
	7. Carve roast across the grain into thick slices and serve.
Recipe Tips:
  - Serve roast with prepared horseradish or your favourite barbecue sauce and a selection of salads, such as potato, coleslaw or mixed greens. For added flavour, soak cedar plank in beer, wine or apple juice. Depending on the size of your roast and the cedar planks, you may need 2 planks. The meat should fit on top over plank (or planks) without overhanging. If using 2 planks, push them together on the grill as close as possible before placing the roast on top.

Recipe Title: Classic Texas-Style Beef Chili
Recipe Summary: This recipe, made with chunky beef stew cubes, is based on a classic Texas-style chili that is traditionally prepared without tomato or beans. It often gets thickened with a corn flour called masa harina, but we used corn tortilla, which results in the same flavour and texture. We also added a cup of coffee to this chili, just like a Texas cowboy would do!

Recipe Methods:
	1. Pat stew cubes dry with paper towel and season all over with half each the salt and pepper. 
	2. Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil over medium-high heat in a Dutch oven. Brown beef in batches, turning and adding up to 1 tbsp (15 mL) more oil as needed, until browned on all sides. Transfer beef to a bowl using a slotted spoon.
	3. Add remaining oil to pot; reduce heat to medium-low. Cook onion and garlic, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes or until starting to soften. Add chili powder, cumin and paprika: cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until fragrant. Pour in broth and coffee. Increase to medium-high and bring to a boil, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from pan. Stir in beef and any accumulated juices, bay leaves and remaining salt and pepper.

Recipe Tips:
  - Patting the stew cubes dry and cooking beef in batches to avoid overcrowding in the pan will help beef to sear and brown instead of steam. Chili flavours intensify after a day or two so leftovers will be even more delicious.

	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) Tex-Mex or Cajun spice, divided
	- ¼ cup (60 mL) all-purpose flour
	- 2 eggs, beaten
	- 1 cup (250 mL) dry seasoned bread crumbs
	- ⅓ cup (75 mL) vegetable oil, divided
	- ⅓ cup (75 mL) mayonnaise

	- 2 tsp (10 mL) fresh lemon juice
	- 4 crusty rolls, split
	- 4 lettuce leaves
	- 1 avocado, halved and sliced
	- 8 slices tomato
	- 4 thinly sliced red onion rounds
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 4 Beef Sirloin Tip Sandwich Steaks (4 to 6 oz/125 to 175 g EACH)
	- Tex-Mex or Cajun spice
	- All-purpose flour
	- 2 eggs
	- 1 cup (250 mL) dry seasoned bread crumbs
	- Vegetable oil
	- Mayonnaise
	- 4 sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil
	- 1 lemon
	- 4 crusty rolls, split
	- 4 lettuce leaves
	- 1 avocado
	- 2 fresh tomatoes
	- 1 red onion
Recipe Methods:
	1. Pat steaks dry with paper towel; season all over with half the Tex-Mex seasoning. Combine remaining Tex-Mex seasoning with flour in a shallow bowl. Place beaten eggs and bread crumbs in two additional separate shallow bowls. Working with one steak at a time, coat steak in flour mixture, dip in egg, then coat in bread crumbs; pressing firmly yet carefully, so that the coating adheres to the meat. Arrange steak in a single layer on a large baking sheet. 
	2. Heat half the oil over medium-high heat in large nonstick skillet; cook steaks, in batches, for about 4 minutes, turning once, until meat is cooked to medium (160ºF/71ºF), coating is golden brown and crisp, and meat is still pink inside. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate in a single layer to drain. Add more oil to skillet as needed between batches.
	3. Meanwhile, combine mayonnaise, sun-dried tomatoes, lemon zest and lemon juice in a small bowl.
	4. Spread mayo mixture all over cut sides of rolls. Layer lettuce on bottom of each roll; top with steak, avocado, tomato and onion. Cut in half on a bias to serve. 
Recipe Tips:
  - Substitute this from-scratch flavoured mayo with store-bought garlic aioli or flavoured mayonnaise. The key to a deliciously golden coating is to have your ingredients all at the ready before you start to cook – don’t skip this important step. Avoid crowding the pan during the frying to ensure an evenly golden coating and don’t layer the cooked steaks on top of each other, as this will cause the coating to steam and become soggy.

	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) sesame seeds

	- Packed brown sugar
	- Asian chili paste, such as Gochujang
	- Minced gingerroot
	- 4 cloves garlic
	- 1 lb (500 g)  Beef Inside Round Fast-fry Steaks,  cut into ¼-inch (5 mm) wide strips

	2. Meanwhile, cook or soak rice noodles according to package directions. Drain and set aside. 
	3. Heat oil over medium-high heat in large nonstick skillet; cook beef strips with the marinade for 2 to 4 minutes, stirring often, until meat is cooked to medium (160ºF/71ºF) and browned but still pink inside, and sauce is sticky but not dry. Remove from heat.

Adding the ingredients at just the right time allows each ingredient to be cooked to perfection avoiding the “mushy” texture you can get when cooking a stew. Try it out yourself!

Recipe Tips:
  - *To grill on a charcoal barbecue, set up your grill for direct-heat cooking: light the charcoal and place directly where you plan to cook the steak (normally right in the centre of the grill). Close the lid, adjust vents as necessary, and allow the grill to preheat for 10 to 12 minutes to 400°F (200°C). Grill the steak over direct heat for 10 to 12 minutes, turning twice or more, or until a digital instant-read thermometer inserted sideways into steak reads 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare doneness at the least (or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-one).

	- 1 cup (250 mL) teriyaki sauce, divided
	- 1 peeled cored pineapple, cut into 1-inch (2.5 cm) chunks (about 24 pieces)

	- 12 small bamboo skewers
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1 lb (500 g) Beef Sirloin Tip Marinating Steak, 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick 
	- Teriyaki sauce
	- 1 pineapple
	- 2 sweet red peppers, seeded
	- 12 small bamboo skewers
Recipe Methods:
	1. Pierce steak all over with fork, cut into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces (about 24 cubes). Add steak and half the teriyaki sauce to a large sealable freezer bag, massaging sauce into meat; seal and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, soak skewers in water for 30 minutes.
	2. Remove beef from marinade; discard used marinade. Pat beef cubes dry with paper towel. Thread 2 beef cubes, 2 pineapple chunks and 2 red pepper chunks on each skewer. 
	3. Grill skewers in a closed preheated barbecue over medium-high heat (400°F/200°C) for 8 to 10 minutes, turning to brown on all sides and basting with remaining teriyaki sauce during the last 2 minutes of cooking, or until peppers are tender and beef is cooked to 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare doneness at the least (or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done).
	4. Transfer to a warmed platter and serve. 
Recipe Tips:
  - Store-bought teriyaki sauce varies from brand to brand, so if the sauce is too thick for basting, stir in up to 2 tbsp (30 mL) pineapple juice or water to thin slightly. Make sure to remove the beef, pineapple and red pepper from skewers before serving to young children. Serve skewers over steamed rice or noodles, and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and green onions, if desired.

Recipe Title: Open-Faced Roast Beef Sandwich with Caramelized Onions
Recipe Summary: In this recipe, the onions slowly cook and caramelize in the oven with the roast resulting in a delicious sauce with all the flavours of classic French onion soup. You can scale up the cheese option to a Gruyère or Emmental, if you like. NOTE: ‘Time-to-cook’ figures are rough guidelines only as cook time is dependent on so many factors such as oven and thermometer accuracy, starting temperature of roast, roast shape and cut. A good thermometer is one of your best kitchen investments.

	- 1 bay leaf
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) vegetable oil

	- ½ tsp (2 mL) freshly ground black pepper
	- Large pinches EACH ground allspice, cloves, ginger and cinnamon
	- 8 large, thick slices crusty bread, toasted (or more)
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 8 pieces  Beef Marrow Bones, Canoe-cut
	- 1 whole small-sized  Beef Digital Flexor Meat  (about 1 lb/500 g) 
	- Salt
	- 1 bay leaf
	- Vegetable oil
	- Onions
	- 4 cloves garlic
	- Strong brewed black coffee
	- Apple cider vinegar
	- Packed light brown sugar
	- Maple syrup
	- Freshly ground black pepper
	- Ground allspice
	- Ground cloves
	- Ground ginger
	- Ground cinnamon
	- 8 large, thick slices crusty bread, toasted (or more)
Recipe Methods:
	1. To prepare marrow bones, with the back of a sturdy knife, scrape off any meat clinging to the outside of the bones. In a large container or nonreactive bowl, stir 3 tbsp (45 mL) salt and 4 quarts (4 L) water together until salt is dissolved. Add the marrow bones, cover and refrigerate overnight or for 24 hours. Drain bones well.
	 2. To make the Jam: Cut the digital meat in half lengthwise and cut each half crosswise into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces. Place in an electric pressure cooker with 1 tsp (5 mL) salt and bay leaf; add 3 cups (750 mL) water. Secure the electric pressure cooker lid making sure the valve is closed. Set pressure to HIGH and time for 1 hour. 
	3. Meanwhile, heat oil over medium heat in a medium-sized pot. Add onions and garlic; cook, stirring frequently, for about 8 to 10 minutes or until the onions are soft and lightly browned. Add the coffee, vinegar, sugar, maple syrup, pepper, allspice, cloves, ginger, cinnamon and ½ tsp (2 mL) salt, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat.
	4. When the pressure cooker timer beeps, let the pressure release naturally. Drain off water, transfer beef a bowl and let cool slightly. Shred into small pieces.
	5. Add beef to the onion mixture and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered and stirring frequently, for 30 to 40 minutes or until the onions are meltingly soft and the liquid is thick and syrupy. If the mixture looks dry, add a touch of water. Taste the jam and adjust it with whatever you think is lacking, be it salt, sugar or vinegar. (Make ahead: The jam can be made in advance. Let cool and refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 4 days or freeze for longer storage.)
	 6. To serve: place the marrow bones 2 inches (5 cm) apart on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Brush bones lightly with oil and season lightly with salt and pepper. Bake in preheated 350ºF for 20 minutes. Warm the jam in a small saucepan over medium-low heat while the bones are roasting, adding a touch of water if it is too thick.
	 7. Serve 1 bone per person with the toast and jam on the side.
Recipe Tips:
  - When preparing the Marrow Bones, the soaking step helps firm up the marrow and helps it be a creamy white. Scraping helps make the bones look more attractive. You can skip this step if you prefer.

	- 1 large sweet red pepper, cut into 1-inch (2.5 cm) chunks
	- ½ cup (125 mL) halved green beans
	- ½ cup (125 mL) coarsely chopped kale
	- Fresh lime juice
	- Fresh cilantro leaves
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1 lb (500 g) Beef Stew Cubes, 1½-inch (3.5 cm) cubes, trimmed
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper
	- Vegetable oil
	- 1 large onion
	- ½-inch (1 cm) piece of gingerroot
	- Yellow curry paste
	- Ground turmeric
	- Chicken broth
	- Coconut milk
	- 1 large carrot
	- 1 large sweet red pepper
	- Green beans
	- Kale
	- Fresh lime juice
	- Fresh cilantro leaves
Recipe Methods:
	1. Season beef cubes all over with salt and pepper to your taste. Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil in a Dutch oven or enamelled cast iron roaster over medium-high heat until sizzling; brown beef, in batches, turning until brown all over and adding more oil, as necessary, between batches. Transfer to a bowl; set aside.
	2. Add onion and gingerroot to pan; sauté for about 3 minutes until just softened. Add curry paste and turmeric; cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in broth, scraping up brown bits from pot. Stir in coconut milk. Stir in reserved beef and any accumulated juices.
	3. Cover tightly; cook in a 325°F oven for 1 hour. Stir in carrot; return to oven and continue cooking for 40 minutes or until carrots and beef are almost tender. Stir in sweet pepper and green beans; return to oven and cook for another 20 minutes, until beef is fork-tender and veggies are tender. Remove slices of gingerroot and stir in kale. Season with fresh lime juice to taste. Serve garnished with cilantro.
Recipe Tips:
  - Browning the beef before simmering gives beef stew a rich colour and flavour. Brown beef in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Overcrowding will cause the meat to steam rather than brown.

	- 1½ cups (375 mL) shredded Tex-Mex cheese blend
	- ½ cup (125 mL) sour cream
	- Lime wedges
Recipe Shopping List:
	- Fresh lime juice
	- Vegetable oil
	- Canned chipotles in adobo sauce
	- Red wine vinegar
	- 2 cloves garlic
	- Ground cumin
	- 1 lb (500 g) Beef Sirloin Tip Marinating Steak,1 inch (2.5 cm) thick

	- Prepared salsa
	- Prepared guacamole
	- Shredded Tex-Mex cheese blend
	- Sour cream
	- Limes
	- Orange juice
	- Liquid honey
	- Dried oregano leaves
Recipe Methods:
	1. Combine lime juice, orange juice, honey, oil, chipotles, vinegar, garlic, cumin and oregano in a small bowl.
	2. Pierce steak all over with a fork. Place in a sealable freezer bag and pour in half the marinade, massaging marinade into meat; seal and refrigerate for 8 to 12 hours. Cover and refrigerate remaining chipotle-honey sauce.
	3. Remove steak from bag; discard used marinade. Pat steak dry with paper towel and season all over with salt and pepper. Grill steak in a closed preheated barbecue over medium-high heat (400°F/200°C) for 8 to 10 minutes for 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick steak, turning twice or more, or until a digital instant-read thermometer inserted sideways into centre of steak reads 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare doneness at the least. Transfer steak to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes.
	 4. Meanwhile, toss onion and peppers with 2 tbsp (30 mL) of the reserved chipotle-honey sauce; grill over medium-high heat (400°F/200°C) for 2 to 3 minutes per side or until lightly charred and tender. Grill tortillas for 30 to 60 seconds or until just warmed through; wrap in foil to keep warm. Cut onions and peppers into thin strips.
	5. Slice steak thinly across the grain. Arrange steak and veggies in a single layer on a platter; drizzle remaining chipotle-honey sauce over top. Serve in warm tortillas with salsa, guacamole, cheese, sour cream and lime wedges. 
Recipe Tips:
  - For a flavour twist, substitute orange juice with pineapple juice and grill pineapple spears along with steak and vegetables for tacos al pastor-style fajitas dinner. Insert two soaked wooden skewers through onion rounds to hold layers together. This makes turning during grilling easier and ensures they don’t fall through the grate on the barbecue.

	- ¾ tsp (4 mL) EACH salt and fresh ground pepper
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) vegetable oil, divided
	- ½ cup (125 mL) grated onion
	- 3 cloves garlic, minced
	- ½ cup (125 mL) ketchup
	- ⅓ cup (75 mL) packed brown sugar
	- ¼ cup (60 mL) EACH cider vinegar and tomato paste
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) Worcestershire sauce
	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) grainy Dijon mustard
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1½ lb (750 g) Beef Rib Finger Meat
	- Chili powder
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper
	- Vegetable oil
	- Onion
	- 3 cloves garlic
	- Ketchup
	- Packed brown sugar
	- Cider vinegar
	- Worcestershire sauce
	- Grainy Dijon mustard
	- Tomato paste
Recipe Methods:
	1. Trim excess fat from the meat to your taste. Starting at the thicker end of each piece of meat, make a cut in between the meat and the fibrous silverskin, lifting the fat and silverskin away from the meat while you trim along the strip of meat. (Tip: Grip the silverskin with a paper towel to prevent slipping.). Discard the trim. Cut meat crosswise into 1½-inch (4 cm) pieces.
	2. Combine chili powder, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add beef pieces to bowl; toss to evenly coat.
	3. Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Brown beef in batches, turning and adding remaining oil as needed, until browned on all over. With slotted spoon, transfer to a 4- to 5-qt (4 to 5 L) slow cooker.
	4. Return skillet to medium heat. Add ¼ cup (60 mL) water, stirring to scrape up any browned bits. Stir in onion, garlic, ketchup, sugar, vinegar, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce and mustard until smooth. Remove from heat and pour over beef in slow cooker; stir to coat. 
	5. Cover and cook on LOW for 6 to 8 hours or HIGH for 3 to 4 hours or until beef is fork-tender and sauce is thickened and bubbling. 
Recipe Tips:
  - The fibrous silverskin on finger meat is tough. Removing it before cooking makes the meat much more tender.

Recipe Title: Thai “Waterfall” Steak Salad (Nam Tok Neua)
Recipe Summary: This salad hails from the northeast region of Thailand, where my mother’s side of the family is from, so northeastern food has a special place in my heart. When most people think about a steak salad, they envision a salad made of leafy greens, with sliced steak on top. But nam tok neua is actually a salad made almost entirely of steak! No vegetables, just lots of fresh herbs, and a spicy and tart dressing. The term “waterfall” or nam tok refers to the dripping (i.e. falling) of meat juices as it’s being grilled. Here in Canada, I love making this in the summer when the grilling season is in full swing. The combination of steak and an abundance of herbs in this salad strikes the perfect balance of not too heavy, yet not too light, and is perfect for a summertime dinner. For a side dish, this salad is served with sticky rice to complete the full northeastern Thai experience (see Tip for Thai Sticky Rice recipe). One of the key ingredients in this salad is toasted rice powder which has a wonderful nutty, toasty aroma, adding depth to the salad and balances the acidity of the lime. It’s a staple ingredient in Northeastern Thailand, and it’s added to many salads, soups and dipping sauces. It is a must-have ingredient in waterfall steak salad.

Add the lemongrass, shallots, mint, cilantro and sawtooth coriander (if using) and toss to combine. Taste and if the flavour is a little too salty, add the remaining water or stock to dilute. Serve immediately with Thai Sticky Rice (see recipe below).
Recipe Tips:
  - To roast hot pepper flakes, place in a dry small skillet and roast over medium heat, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes or until dark red and fragrant. Immediately transfer to a bowl and let cool. Thai Sticky Rice: Place 1 cup (250 mL) Thai glutinous rice in a bowl, add cold or room temperature water to cover and swish, then drain. Repeat 3 to 4 times until the water runs mostly clear. Add room temperature water to cover rice by about 2 inches (5 cm) and let soak for at least 3 hours, preferably 4, and for up to 12 hours. To cook rice, drain rice well. Place in a traditional bamboo cone steamer or cheesecloth-lined steamer rack and steam over boiling water for 20 to 25 minutes or until tender. Let stand, covered, until serving.

Recipe Title: Beef Liver and Red Pepper Stir-fry
Recipe Summary: Stir-fry recipes are true weeknight heroes since they come together quickly and are packed with flavour. Plus, by pairing an iron-rich animal-protein, like beef liver, with a plant-based source of iron, like fresh spinach, this recipe has an impressive iron punch. Finish the dish with lemon juice to boost iron absorption and perk flavours. Liver is the most delicious when it is still a bit pink inside and is slightly springy to the touch.

	- Garlic
	- Jalapeño
	- 1 lime
	- Fresh herbs (parsley, chives, thyme)
	- Romaine lettuce

	- Salt
	- Pepper
	- Dried oregano leaves
	- Ground cumin
	- Unsalted butter
	- Aged white Cheddar cheese
	- Eggs
Recipe Methods:
	1. Pico de Gallo: Combine tomatoes, onion, cilantro, garlic, jalapeño, lime juice, oregano and cumin in a bowl. Set aside.
	2. Burritos: Pat steak dry with paper towel and cut across the grain into thin strips. Place in a bowl, drizzle lightly with olive oil and season with salt and pepper to your taste. Toss to combine and set aside.
	3. Whisk eggs in a bowl until blended; whisk in mixed herbs and season with a pinch each of salt and pepper.
	4. Melt 1 tbsp (15 mL) of the butter over medium heat in a nonstick skillet. Add eggs and cook, stirring with a heatproof spatula, for 2 to 3 minutes or until eggs are fluffy, dry and well scrambled. Season with salt to taste. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
	5. Clean pan and return to medium-high heat. Add beef strips and cook for about 1 minute per side or until browned by still pink inside. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; set aside. Clean the pan again and place on medium-low heat.
	6. Scoop the avocado out of its skin and mash well using a fork; season with salt and pepper to taste.
	7. Gently warm the flour tortillas in the microwave for 30 seconds. (Warming the tortillas makes them easier to roll.)
	8. Place tortillas on a work surface. Arrange beef in a line down the centre, dividing equally between tortillas. Top with scrambled eggs, avocado, cheese, red onion and romaine lettuce. Fold ends over filling and roll up tightly.
	9. Add remaining butter to the skillet and heat until frothy. Add burritos with the seam side down. Cook, pressing down with a heatproof plate, a small skillet or skillet lid and turning once, for about 6 to 10 minutes or until golden brown on both sides. 
	10. Serve toasted burritos with Pico de Gallo and hot pepper sauce, as desired.
Recipe Tips:
  - Toasting ground cumin brings out the flavour and adds a deeper taste to the pico de gallo. To toast, place ground cumin in a small, dry skillet and toast over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, for about 1 minute or until slightly darker and fragrant. Immediately transfer to a bowl. Chef Hayden recommends having extra tortillas on hand in case they rip when stuffing and rolling the burritos.

Recipe Methods:
	1. Slice the meat in half lengthwise and cut each piece in half crosswise. Season all over with salt and pepper to your taste. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add meat, in batches as necessary, and cook, turning with tongs, until browned on all sides. Transfer to a minimum 4-qt (4 L) slow cooker.

Spoon the meat into the buns and tuck a spoonful of giardinera into each. Serve immediately with extra giardinera on the side.
Recipe Tips:
  - To oven-braise instead of using the slow cooker: Brown meat as in Step 1 using a Dutch oven or enamelled cast-iron roaster instead of a skillet. Transfer meat to a platter; cook onions and garlic as in step 2, adding broth and seasonings to pan after browning. Return meat to Dutch oven, cover with tight fitting lid and transfer to a preheated 325°F (160°C) oven to braise until meat is fall-apart tender, about 1½ to 2 hours.

Recipe Title: Beef Satay (Neua Satay) 
Recipe Summary: Satay is ubiquitous in Thailand—you can find it as street food, or even as an appetizer in a sit-down restaurant. When I was a kid, we frequented a neighborhood restaurant that sold mostly noodles, but the satay and peanut sauce was their specialty appetizer. The satay was always the highlight of the meal for me, more so than the noodles! While most satays in Thailand are made from pork nowadays, the original satay came to Thailand as beef, because it originated from Indonesia, a primarily Muslim country that does not eat much pork. This slowly changed to pork because in Thailand pork is more accessible.  Our satay is always served with white toast and ajaad, a quick cucumber pickle that serves as a crunchy, fresh and acidic element to balance the richness of the peanut sauce. The toast is there to sop up any extra peanut sauce left at the end, and it’s my favourite part of satay!

	- Palm sugar or brown sugar
	- Brown sugar
	- Granulated sugar
	- Salt
	- Roasted peanuts
	- White sesame seeds
	- Twelve to fourteen 6-inch (15 cm) bamboo skewers
Recipe Methods:
	Cut the beef across the grain into ¼-inch (0.5 cm) thick slices, then cut each slice crosswise into small, bite-sized pieces. Place in a bowl and set aside.
	Marinade: 
		Grind coriander seeds, cumin seeds and black peppercorns using a mortar and pestle until very fine. Add lemongrass, galangal (if using) and fresh turmeric (if using); pound into a fine paste. Add ground turmeric (if using), brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, coconut milk and vinegar; stir to mix well.
		Pour marinade over beef and massage it with your hands, making sure that no pieces of meat are stuck together. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight. Meanwhile, soak skewers in water for at least 30 minutes.
	Peanut Sauce: 
		Meanwhile, grind peanuts and sesame seeds in a food processor or using a mortar and pestle into a fine meal, being careful not to over grind them into nut butter. Set aside.
		Bring ¼ cup (60 mL) of the coconut milk to a boil over medium heat in a small saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in red curry paste, mixing well. Simmer for about 2 minutes, stirring, until it is very thick and coconut oil starts to separate from the paste.&nbsp;Stir in remaining coconut milk, ground peanuts and sesame seeds, palm sugar, 2 tbsp (30 mL) tamarind paste and 1 tsp (5 mL) fish sauce. Simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until thickened into a dip-like consistency. Remove from heat. Taste and adjust seasoning with more sugar, fish sauce and tamarind paste as needed. Set aside.
	Ajadd: 
		Combine vinegar, sugar and salt in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring, just until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and let cool completely.&nbsp;
		Remove beef from marinade; discard marinade. Skewer 3 pieces of beef onto each of the soaked skewers, making sure the skewer goes through the beef so the bamboo isn’t exposed and making sure tip of the skewer also is covered with beef. Place flat on a plate.&nbsp;
		Just before cooking the skewers, combine cucumber, shallot and chilies in a small bowl, then pour in cooled vinegar mixture over to make the Ajaad. Let stand for up to 10 minutes at the most.
		Cut 2 pieces of foil, each 8 inches (20 cm) wide. Fold each in half lengthwise so that you have a long rectangle about 4 inches (10 cm) wide. Place onto the grill to act as guards to prevent the handles of the skewers from burning. Brush the top side of skewers with coconut milk. Place the brushed side down on an oiled preheated grill over medium heat (350°F/180°C) with the handle of skewers resting on foil. Grill for about 1 minute or until grill marked while brushing the top side of the skewers with remaining coconut milk. Flip the skewers and grill for about 2 to 3 minutes or until cooked to medium-rare at the least (145°F/63°C). Meanwhile, if you have space on the grill, grill bread until toasted on both sides or transfer skewers to a clean plate and grill bread.
		Serve the Satay on a platter alongside the Peanut Sauce, Ajaad and toast.
Recipe Tips:
  - For the ajaad, combine the cucumber with the pickling liquid no longer than about 10 minutes before serving to preserve the crunch and freshness of the cucumber.

Recipe Title: Grilled Lime-Marinated Beef Tostada Salad
Recipe Summary: With lean grilled beef and market-fresh veggies, this crispy crunchy main-course salad has all the satisfaction of a nacho platter with a fraction of the fat and a BIG boost of nutrients. Using oven-toasted whole wheat flour tortillas as the tostada base is a healthier choice than traditional fried corn tortillas. When cooking the corn and tomatoes, heat just enough to combine and develop their flavours.

Recipe Title: Classic Oven Roast Beef with Rosemary Cream Sauce
Recipe Summary: Roast beef is so simple (and impressive) for entertaining – just season (simply), oven-sear and slow-roast for best results. Use a meat thermometer to cook your roast to the doneness that you like the best – without overcooking it! Our time-test results are based on a roast that was about 8½-in (21 cm) long x 4½-in (11 cm) wide x 3½-in (9 cm) deep. NOTE: ‘Time-to-cook’ figures are rough guidelines only as cook time is dependent on so many factors such as oven and thermometer accuracy, starting temperature of roast, roast shape and cut. A good thermometer is one of your best kitchen investments.

	- 12 cilantro stems
	- 6 cloves garlic, peeled
	- 6 whole cloves
	- 4 bay leaves
	- 2 tsp (10 mL) salt
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) dried oregano, preferably Mexican
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) vegetable oil (optional)
	- 18 small corn tortillas, warmed
	- 1 cup (250 mL) finely diced onion
	- 1 cup (250 mL) coarsely chopped fresh cilantro 
	- 2 limes, cut into wedges
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1  Beef Tongue   (about 2 lb/1 kg)
	- 12 cilantro stems
	- 6 cloves garlic
	- 6 whole cloves
	- 4 bay leaves
	- Salt
	- Dried oregano, preferably Mexican
	- Vegetable oil (optional)
	- 18 small corn tortillas
	- Onions
	- Fresh cilantro
	- 2 limes
Recipe Methods:
	1. Trim any excess fat from tongue with a sharp knife. Place in an electric pressure cooker and add the 4 cups (1 L) water, cilantro stems, garlic, cloves, bay leaves, salt and oregano. Seal the pot making sure the vent is closed. Set the pressure to HIGH and time for 1½ hours. When the timer beeps, let the pressure release naturally.
	2. Remove the tongue from the liquid and transfer to a cutting board; let cool. You can strain the liquid and serve it along with the tacos with a squeeze of lime, or discard.
	3. When tongue is cool enough to handle, peel off the skin. Start at the back end and use a small knife to lift up the skin; then, using your fingers, peel off the skin like removing a mitten, being careful to not rip the meat at the tip. Discard the skin, trim off any fat, gristle or bumps at the back of the tongue. 
	4. There are three ways to prepare the meat for serving. The meat can be roughly chopped and served as-is, it can be cut fried until crisp, or you can serve a combination of each. To crisp the meat, cut the meat into ¼- to 1/2-inch (5 mm to 1 cm) slices. Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) of vegetable oil in a nonstick skillet. Add a single layer of the meat, leaving space between each piece. Fry, stirring occasionally, for 6 to 8 minutes until the meat is crisp. Repeat with remaining slices, as necessary, adding oil to pan between batches.  
	5. Serve tongue on a plate with tortillas, onions, cilantro and lime wedges in bowls for each person to build their own tacos.
Recipe Tips:
  - The tongue can be cooked on top of the stove instead of the electric pressure cooker. Proceed with step 1 placing the tongue in a large pot with enough water to cover it by 2 inches (5 cm). Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 3 to 4 hours until the tongue is tender, replenishing the water as necessary. Remove a thin slice from the thickest part of the tongue to check. If you wish to serve the liquid, remove the tongue and boil liquid until reduced to 4 cups (1 L). Proceed with step 2.

	1. Fruit Salsa: Combine tomato, red onion, mango, cucumber, cilantro, lime zest and juice in medium bowl; season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate. (Make ahead: Salsa may be made several hours in advance.)
	2. Steaks: Pat steaks dry with paper towel and season all over with salt and cracked black pepper to your taste. 
	3. Grill steaks in a closed preheated barbecue over medium-high heat (400°F/200°C) for 10 to 12 minutes for 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick steaks, turning twice or more, or until a digital instant-read thermometer inserted sideways into centre of steaks reads 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare doneness at the least.
	4. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving with Fruit Salsa.
Recipe Tips:
  - Seasoning prior to grilling enhances the flavour better than if you season the steaks after grilling.

Recipe Title: Pressure Cooker Japanese-Style Beef Curry
Recipe Summary: In the 1870’s, the developing Japanese navy modeled itself on the British navy. The curry meals served on board were adopted and quickly became part of the food culture in Japan. As a point of reference, it’s as popular as ramen is. Curries have been adapted over the years and may be seasoned with honey and ketchup to make it sweeter, and mayonnaise to give it a creamier texture.

	- Sliced green onions (optional)
Recipe Shopping List:
	- Vegetable oil
	- 2 lb (1 kg)  Beef Boneless Hind Shank (Bubble Meat)
	- 4 cloves garlic
	- 2-inch (5 cm) piece fresh gingerroot
	- 2 tart and sweet apples such as Fuji
	- Beef broth
	- Soy sauce

	- Curry powder
	- Cocoa powder
	- 1 lb (500 g) potatoes
	- 12 oz (375 g) medium carrots
	- Short grain rice
	- Green onions (optional)
Recipe Methods:
	1. Slice the meat in half lengthwise and cut each piece crosswise into 2-inch (5 cm) lengths. Heat 2 tbsp (30 mL) oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add the beef, in batches, and cook until brown on all sides, adding more oil as needed. Using a slotted spoon, transfer beef to an electric pressure cooker as it’s browned. 
	2. Reduce heat to medium-low and add any remaining oil to pan. Add onions, garlic and gingerroot to skillet; cook, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes until golden brown and very soft. Transfer to pressure cooker and stir in apples, broth and 2 tbsp (30 mL) soy sauce. Secure the electric pressure cooker lid making sure the valve is closed. Set the pressure to HIGH and time for 1 hour. 
	3. Meanwhile, make a curry thickening mixture: melt butter over medium-low heat in a small skillet; add flour and cook, stirring constantly, for about 5 minutes or until mixture turns a lightly toasted, almond brown. Add curry powder and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in cocoa powder. Set aside.
	4. When the timer beeps, quick release the pressure and remove lid. Scoop out 1 cup (250 mL) of the liquid and gradually whisk into the curry mixture, then gradually whisk mixture back into the liquid in the pot. Stir in potatoes and carrots. Set the cooker to medium sauté and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes or until vegetables are tender.
	5. Stir in 1 tbsp (15 mL) Worcestershire sauce. Taste and adjust with more soy sauce and Worcestershire, if desired. Serve immediately with rice. Garnish with green onions, if desired.
Recipe Tips:
  - To prepare on the stovetop, add ingredients to a large Dutch oven or enamelled cast-iron roaster instead of an electric pressure cooker. Add 2 cups (500 mL) extra beef broth. Cover and simmer over low heat for 3 hours making sure the liquid covers the beef and adding more if necessary. Add the curry mixture and vegetables. Simmer, uncovered, for 20 to 30 minutes until the vegetables are tender.

		- 1 jar (680 mL) tomato passata (strained tomatoes)
		- 2 sprigs fresh basil (about 10 leaves)
		- 1 small onion, halved
		- 2 cloves garlic
		- 1 tsp (5 mL) dried oregano leaves
		- ½ tsp (2 mL) salt
		- ¼ tsp (1 mL) hot pepper flakes
Recipe Shopping List:
	- Fresh flat leaf parsley
	- Garlic 
	- Fresh basil
	- 1 small onion
	- 1 lb (500 g) Beef Inside Round or Eye of Round cutlets/fast-fry steaks (about 4 to 6 cutlets)

	- 1 jar (680 mL) tomato passata (strained tomatoes)
	- Dried oregano leaves
	- Salt
	- Pepper
	- Hot pepper flakes
	- Grated Parmesan cheese 
Recipe Methods:
	1. Cut a sealable bag along one side and bottom to open up easily. Place a cutlet inside and close bag.&nbsp; Pound out the cutlet using a flat meat mallet until very thin. Remove to a baking sheet and repeat with remaining cutlets. 
	2. Arrange cutlets in a single layer on the sheet and sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper. Spread cutlets with cheese, parsley and garlic, dividing equally. Starting the narrower short side, roll up jelly-roll style and secure with butcher’s string or a toothpick. 
	3. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a wide saucepan. Add beef and brown, turning, until browned on all sides. Add wine and turn rolls again; simmer for 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low.
	4. Tomato Sauce: Add tomato passata, ½ cup (125 mL) water, basil, onion, garlic, oregano, salt and hot pepper flakes to pan and stir gently. Bring to a simmer. 
	5. Cover, reduce heat to low and gently simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 2½ hours or until beef is fork-tender. Scoop beef from sauce and place on serving plates.
Recipe Tips:
  - Be sure to tell your family and guests to remove the string or toothpick before enjoying! If you do not have sealable bags, use plastic wrap, parchment paper or waxed paper to pound the beef out thinly. If cutlets are very large cut them in half crosswise to get 2 similar-size cutlets; it helps cook the braciole evenly when you start with cutlets all the same size.

	- 1 bulb fennel
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) olive oil
	- 2 shallots or 1 small onion, thinly sliced
	- 1 small sweet red pepper, seeded and finely chopped
	- 2 cloves garlic, minced
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) finely chopped fresh rosemary (or ¼ tsp/1 mL crumbled dried rosemary)
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) EACH salt and fresh ground pepper
	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) balsamic vinegar
	- 1 cup (250 mL) quinoa, rinsed
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) grated orange or lemon zest
	- 3 cups (750 mL) baby spinach
	- ¼ cup (60 mL) grated Parmesan cheese
Recipe Shopping List: ???
Recipe Methods:
	1. Trim feathery fronds from fennel bulb; coarsely chop and set aside for garnish. Trim off thick stalks from bulb and discard. Cut bulb in half lengthwise and trim out tough core. Place bulb halves cut side-down and cut crosswise into thin slices.&nbsp;
	2. Heat oil over medium heat in a large saucepan. Add shallots and fennel; cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes or until fennel starts to soften. Add red pepper, garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper; cook, stirring, for 3 minutes or until pepper is softened.&nbsp;
	3. Stir in quinoa. Pour in 2 cups (500 mL) water and balsamic vinegar and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for about 15 minutes or until almost all the liquid has been absorbed. Remove from heat.&nbsp;
	4. Sprinkle in orange zest and spinach; fold in gently with a spatula. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes until spinach is wilted. Stir Parmesan into pilaf and garnish with reserved fennel fronds.&nbsp;
Recipe Tips:
  - Fennel has a mild licorice flavour and a texture similar to celery. Be sure to save the feathery fronds to use like an herb for garnish–they’re pretty and add a punch of fresh flavour. If fennel bulb isn’t available, substitute 3 stalks of celery, thinly sliced, and ½ tsp (2 mL) crushed fennel or anise seeds.

Recipe Ingredients List:
	- Wood chips, soaked according to package directions 
	- 2½ lb (1.3 g) Beef Rib Finger Meat
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) Montreal-style steak spice
	- ¾ cup (175 mL) barbecue sauce
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) butter, melted
Recipe Shopping List:
	- Wood chips, soaked according to package directions 
	- 2½ lb (1.3 g) Beef Rib Finger Meat
	- Montreal-style steak spice
	- Barbecue sauce
	- Butter
Recipe Methods:
	1. Fill drip pan part way with water and place under grill (off to one side). Preheat barbecue to medium-high (400°F/200°C). Turn off burner under drip pan. 
	2. Add soaked wood chips to smoker box. Alternatively, wrap 2 cups (5 oz/150 g) wood chips loosely in foil to create a small pouch, punching a few holes at the top of the pouch to let the smoke out. Place smoker box or pouch on the grill grate above the burner that is turned on for 10 to 20 minutes, or until starting to smoke.
	3. Meanwhile, trim excess fat from the meat to your taste. Starting at the thicker end of each piece of meat, make a cut in between the meat and the fibrous silverskin, lifting the fat and silverskin away from the meat while you trim along the strip of meat. (Tip: Grip the silverskin with a paper towel to prevent slipping.). Discard the trim. 
	4. Place meat in a large bowl. Sprinkle with steak spice and toss until evenly coated.
	5. When wood chips start to smoke, place meat on grill over the drip pan (off the heat). Close lid and cook for about 2 hours or until a thick crust has developed.
	6. Remove meat from grill; let cool for 10 minutes. Cut meat crosswise into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces. Transfer to a 13 x 9-inch (3 L) foil pan. Combine barbecue sauce with melted butter in a bowl; pour over meat and toss to coat. Cover pan tightly with foil. 
	7. Place foil pan on grill over drip pan. Close lid and cook for 45 to 60 minutes or until meat is fork-tender. Remove foil cover; continue to cook for 15 to 20 minutes or until sauce has caramelized and meat is glazed. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving. 
Recipe Tips:
  - Serve Ends as an appetizer as beef bites with toothpicks, or as a meal, in a bun with slaw and an array of barbecue sides, or as a topping for poutine, mac and cheese or tacos, or even as a decadent breakfast or brunch side dish. The fibrous silverskin on finger meat is tough. Removing it before cooking makes the meat much more tender. Double the recipe to serve a hungry crowd.

Recipe Title: Mediterranean Oven Roast and Carrots
Recipe Summary: Fragrant herbs and garlic season the Top Sirloin and vegetables as they slow roast in the oven. The sun-dried tomato sauce adds that finishing touch for a taste of the Mediterranean. Use a meat thermometer to cook your roast to the doneness that you like the best – without overcooking it!

Recipe Title: Sous Vide Osso Buco-style Simmering Steak
Recipe Summary: With the traditional flavours of tomato- and wine-braised osso buco, this simmering steak can go from every day to entertaining-worthy with ease. Slow, even sous vide cooking is just the thing to make the most of this beef cut. You can even cook it to medium-rare and get a tender, juicy result which is quite different from the well-done temperature of traditional braising.

Recipe Shopping List:
	- Garlic
	- Red onion
	- Fresh parsley
	- Crusty bread
	- 1 lb (500 g) Medium or Lean Ground Beef
	- ¾ cup (175 mL) grated Parmesan cheese, preferably Parmigiano Reggiano (about 2½ oz/75 g)
	- Olive oil
	- Salt
	- Pepper 
	- Bay leaf
	- 2 bottles (EACH 680 mL) passata (strained tomatoes) or 2 cans (EACH 28 oz/796 mL) canned crushed tomatoes
	- Egg
	- Garlic butter
	- Milk
Recipe Methods:
	1. Meatballs: Place bread cubes in a large bowl and pour in milk; stir to coat. Let soak for 15 minutes.
	2. Sauce: Meanwhile, heat oil over medium heat in a wide sauté pan or deep skillet. Cook onion, stirring, for about 5 minutes or until soft. Add garlic and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes or until fragrant. Stir in tomatoes, pepper and bay leaf. Rinse passata bottles with about ¼ cup (60 mL) water each and pour into pan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes.
	3. Meanwhile, mash soaked bread into small pieces with a fork. Add garlic, parsley, egg, salt and pepper and beat with a fork until blended. Add beef and Parmesan and gently mix in with fork (careful not to over-mix).
	4. Scoop heaping tablespoonfuls (15 mL) of the meat mixture and roll into about twenty 1½ -inch (4 cm) meatballs. Place on a baking sheet or plate.
	5. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Cook meatballs, in batches and turning as needed, until browned all over. Transfer to simmering sauce as they are browned. Add more oil to skillet between batches, as necessary. 
	6. Spoon sauce over meatballs to cover; simmer in sauce, gently stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes or until a digital instant-read thermometer inserted sideways into several meatballs reads 160°F (71°C) at the least.

	8. Spoon meatballs and sauce into shallow serving bowls and serve with Garlic Bread.
Recipe Tips:
  - Soaking dried bread makes for extra-moist, tender meatballs. You’ll need 1 to 2 slices of bread to make the cubes for the meatballs. Use bread that’s a day or two old, or cut into cubes and let dry at room temperature for a day or spread on a baking sheet and dry in a 250F (x C) oven for about 30 minutes. If using canned crushed tomatoes, you’ll need about one-and-three-quarters 28 oz (796 mL) cans for this recipe. Refrigerate or freeze any extra tomatoes in an airtight container for another use.

	-  Gravy

	- Fresh ground pepper
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 12 Beef Inside Round Fast-fry Steaks,  each 6 inches (15 cm) long (about 1½ lb/750 g total)
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper
	- All-purpose flour
	- Milk
	- 2 eggs
	- Vegetable oil
	- Butter
Recipe Methods:
	1. Pat steaks dry with paper towel; season all over with salt and pepper. Place flour in a shallow bowl. Whisk milk with eggs in a separate shallow bowl. Working with one slice at a time, coat steak in flour, dip in milk mixture and then return to flour. Coat steak completely with flour; pressing firmly yet carefully, so that the coating adheres to the meat. Arrange steaks in a single layer on a large baking sheet. 
	2. Heat half the oil over medium-high heat in large nonstick skillet; cook steaks, in batches, for 4 minutes, turning once, until meat is cooked to medium (160ºF/71ºF), coating is golden brown and meat is still pink inside. Transfer to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and keep warm in preheated 250ºF oven. Add more oil to skillet as needed between batches. (If steaks begin to brown too quickly, reduce heat slightly or if steaks are not sizzling when added to the pan, increase heat.) 
	3. Gravy Discard any remaining oil from skillet. Wipe skillet with paper towel to remove any overly browned bits. Melt butter over medium heat in skillet. Sprinkle in flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes or until a lightly browned paste forms. Pour in about ½ cup (125 mL) of the milk, whisking constantly, until mixture is smooth. Whisk in remaining milk; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and boil gently, stirring occasionally, for about 3 to 5 minutes or until sauce has thickened to gravy consistency. Season with salt and ½ tsp (2 mL) pepper. 
	4. Serve sauce over steaks and finish with additional pepper, if desired.
Recipe Tips:
  - Avoid crowding the pan during the frying to ensure an evenly golden coating and don’t layer the cooked steaks on top of each other, as this will cause the coating to steam and become soggy. You can elevate the cream sauce by adding a splash of white wine and up to 1 tsp (5 mL) dried thyme or crumbled sage leaves before whisking in the milk.

	- 4 ears corn, husked 
	- 4 green onions, trimmed 
	- 1 EACH sweet yellow and red pepper, seeded, cut into quarters
Recipe Shopping List:
	- Barbecue sauce
	- Fresh lemon juice
	- Prepared horseradish
	- 3 sprigs fresh rosemary
	- 1  Beef Tomahawk-style Rib Grilling Steak,  1-bone thick (about 2½ lb/1.3 kg)
	- Large cedar plank (or 2 if necessary, see Tip below)
	- 1 can or bottle (355 to 473 mL) dark beer 
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper 
	- Vegetable oil 
	-  Salsa 
	- Grape tomatoes
	- 8 cloves garlic
	- Vegetable oil
	- 4 ears corn
	- 4 green onions
	- Sweet yellow and red peppers, seeded
Recipe Methods:
	1. Combine barbecue sauce, lemon juice, horseradish and rosemary in an extra-large or large sealable freezer bag. Transfer ½ cup (125 mL) to a bowl and set aside for Salsa. Pat steak dry with paper towel and add to bag, massaging meat with marinade; close bag (it may not seal if bone sticks out), place in a large container and refrigerate for 2 hours. 
	2. Meanwhile, soak cedar plank for at least 2 hours in a container with enough beer and warm water mixture to cover, weighing down with heavy jars to submerge. 
	 3. Salsa: Meanwhile, soak skewers in water for at least 30 minutes. Alternately thread grape tomatoes and garlic onto skewers. Brush skewers, corn, green onions and peppers all over with oil and season with salt and pepper. Starting with corn, grill vegetables in closed preheated barbecue over medium-high heat (400˚F/200˚C), turning occasionally, until charred all over. Let cool slightly. Cut kernels from cobs into a bowl. Remove tomatoes and garlic from skewers. Coarsely chop remaining vegetables and add to corn with reserved barbecue sauce mixture, tossing to coat.
	4. Remove steak from marinade; discard marinade. Pat steak dry with paper towel; wipe any marinade off bone well. Season meat all over with salt and pepper to your taste. 
	5. Discard soaking liquid from plank. Heat plank in closed preheated barbecue over medium-high heat (400˚F/200˚C) for about 3 minutes or until plank crackles and smokes. Brush top side with oil.
	6. Insert oven-safe meat thermometer sideways into the centre of the steak, avoiding fat or bone. Place steak on plank. Cook in closed barbecue, without turning, for about 45 minutes or until digital instant-read thermometer inserted sideways into steak reads 120˚F (49˚C). 
	7. Remove steak from plank (let plank cool and discard) and sear steak directly on the hot grill with the lid open, turning once, for 4 to 6 minutes for medium-rare, removing from grill when 10°F (6°C) below desired finished temperature (145°F/63°C for medium-rare, or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done). Transfer steak to cutting board, cover loosely with foil and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
	8. Carve meat from the bone and across the grain into thin slices. Arrange on cutting board or platter with the bone and serve with Salsa.
Recipe Tips:
  - Depending on the size of your steak and the cedar planks, you may need 2 planks. The meat and bone should fit on top over plank (or planks) without overhanging. If using 2 planks, push them together on the grill as close as possible before placing the steak on top. When marinating the steak in the bag, keep the bone out of the marinade; this will prevent it from charring too much when grilling.

Recipe Title: Crusted Oven-Roasted Beef and Veg with Horseradish Sauce

You reap its flavourful benefits in the vegetables and sauce, too, by having bits of the crust come off from the roast into the pan. You can use regular potatoes, sweet potatoes or a mix of both.

	2. Trim excess fat from the meat to your taste. Starting at the thicker end of each piece of meat, make a cut in between the meat and the fibrous silverskin, lifting the fat and silverskin away from the meat while you trim along the strip of meat. (Tip: Grip the silverskin with a paper towel to prevent slipping.). Discard the trim. Cut the meat crosswise into 1½-inch (4 cm) pieces and place in a bowl.
	3. Add reserved Baharat Spice Mix for beef, garlic, salt, marjoram and oil to the beef. Mix well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight. If using bamboo skewers, soak in water for at least 30 minutes.
	4. Salata Hara: Meanwhile, cut out core from the tomatoes; cut each tomato in half crosswise and squeeze out the seeds. Chop coarsely and place in a food processor. Add cilantro, serrano, garlic, lemon juice, salt and reserved 2 tsp (10 mL) Baharat Spice Blend. Pulse until the tomatoes are finely chopped. Season with salt to taste. Cover and refrigerate until serving, for up to 1 day.
	5. Thread the meat pieces onto skewers, dividing evenly. Grill skewers on a lightly oiled grill in a closed preheated barbecue over medium-high heat (400°F/200°C) for 6 to 10 minutes, turning twice or more, until instant-read thermometer inserted into cubes reads 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare at the least (or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done). Serve immediately with Salata Hara for dipping.
Recipe Tips:
  - The membrane on finger meat is tough. Removing it from the meat makes the meat more tender.

Recipe Methods:
	1. Season beef all over with salt and pepper to your taste. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook, turning with tongs, until browned on all sides (it will curl while cooking and this is fine). Transfer to electric pressure cooker. Set aside. 
	 2. Add onions and garlic to the skillet and reduce heat to low. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes or until the onions soften and start to brown. Add paprika and caraway seeds; cook, stirring, for about 30 seconds or until fragrant. Add the beef broth and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. 
	3. Pour broth mixture over the beef in pressure cooker. Stir in tomato paste, thyme, bay leaf, cayenne, cloves and ½ tsp (2 mL) salt. Seal the electric pressure cooker lid and make sure the vent is closed. Set the pressure to HIGH and time for 1 hour. 
	4. When the timer beeps, allow pressure to release naturally for 10 minutes, then quick release remaining pressure. Turn off the pot and remove the lid. The sauce should be lightly thickened. If not, remove the meat with a slotted spoon and keep warm in a bowl. Set cooker on sauté and boil sauce until it thickens slightly. There should be approximately 3 cups (750 mL) of sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary, adding a good sprinkling of pepper. Discard bay leaf and thyme stems.
	5. Slice each piece of meat across the grain into slices. Arrange the meat in 4 separate bowls or plates with your noodles. Cover with the sauce and sprinkle with dill. Serve with sour cream, if desired.
Recipe Tips:
  - Stovetop instructions: Prepare the ingredients, adding them to a large Dutch oven or enamelled cast-iron roaster instead of an electric pressure cooker. Increase the beef broth to 4 cups (1 L). Cover tightly and simmer over low heat for three hours.

	- 8 lbs (3.5 kg) Beef Soup Bones, 2- to 3-inch (5 to 7.5 cm) pieces
	- 2 lb (1 kg) Boneless Beef Digital Flexor Meat or Hind Shank (Bubble Meat) 
	- Cooked short grain rice 
	- A generous amount of thinly sliced green onions
	- Salt
	- Kimchi
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 8 lbs (3.5 kg)  Beef Soup Bones,  2- to 3-inch (5 to 7.5 cm) pieces
	- 2 lb (1 kg)  Boneless Beef Digital Flexor Meat or Hind Shank (Bubble Meat) 
	- Cooked short grain rice 
	- Green onions
	- Salt
	- Kimchi
Recipe Methods:
	1. Rinse the bones and meat with cold water. Place in a large bowl, pot or container and add cold water to cover bones. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
	2. Drain off soaking water. Combine beef bones and meat in a 12-quart (12 L) stockpot. Add cold water to cover by 2 inches (5 cm). Bring to a boil over high heat; boil, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Drain and discard the water. 
	3. Rinse the bones and meat under cool water, carefully removing any scum clinging to the bones. Wash out the pot and return the bones and meat to the pot. Add 8 quarts (8 L) water and return to a boil over high heat. Remove any scum that rises to the surface with a large spoon, then turn down to a medium-low. Cover and boil for 2 to 3 hours, until meat is tender (timing will depend on the cut used). 
	4. Remove the meat from broth with a slotted spoon and place in a bowl of cold water to prevent it from darkening. When meat is cool, remove from the water, cover and refrigerate until serving. Meanwhile, continue boiling the broth for 1 to 2 hours longer (for a total of 4 hours), maintaining a water level of 2 inches (7.5 cm) above the bones by adding water as needed, until flavour is developed. Maintain a steady boil while cooking. 
	 5. Drain the broth through a colander or large sieve into a large bowl or another pot; reserve the liquid and return bones to the stockpot. Let broth from this first cooking cool, then cover and refrigerate. Add 6 quarts (6 L) of water to the bones and return to the heat. Cover and cook, as above, maintaining a steady boil for 4 hours.
	6. Add the first broth to the broth in the pot. Cover and boil once more for 4 hours, allowing the water to reduce to just above the level of the bones. Remove from the heat and strain, reserving the liquid. Discard solids. There should be approximately 6 quarts (6 L). If you’re not serving it immediately, let cool and refrigerate. Store broth in airtight containers in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 6 months.
	7. Soup: When ready to serve, skim off the fat, if desired. For each serving, bring 2 cups (500 mL) broth to a boil over high heat in a saucepan. Slice the reserved meat across the grain into ¼-inch (5 mm) thick slices, using 6 slices per person, or more or less as you prefer. Ladle the broth into bowls and add slices of the meat. Set out individual bowls of rice, green onions, salt and kimchi for each diner to add to their serving to their taste. Or alternatively, the rice can be put into the soup or eaten on the side with kimchi.
Recipe Tips:
  - The broth and bones from the first boiling can be refrigerated overnight and the second boiling of the bones resumed the next day. Soaking the bones and meat overnight plus the initial brief boiling ensures that the broth remains white, rather than turning an unappetizing pinky-gray colour.

Recipe Title: Barbecued Mustard-Rubbed Roast Beef with Apple Salsa
Recipe Summary: This juicy roast beef features a savoury herb and mustard crust and unique apple salsa.

	- 3 tbsp (45 mL) cornstarch
Recipe Shopping List:
	- Gingerroot
	- 1 shallot
	- Garlic
	- 1 daikon radish (about 1¼ lb/625 g)
	- 2 lb (1 kg) Beef Brisket or Blade Pot Roast, cut into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces
	- Sunflower or canola oil
	- Chinese cooking wine
	- Oyster sauce
	- Hoisin sauce
	- Soy sauce

	- Chinese five spice powder
	- 1 dried chenpi (dried mandarin peel) 
	- Star anise
	- Salt
	- Bay leaves
	- Rock sugar or brown sugar
	- Cornstarch
Recipe Methods:
	1. Combine chenpi and warm water in a bowl. Let soak for about 15 minutes. Drain, discarding soaking water.
	2. Meanwhile, combine beef, 3 of the gingerroot slices and 3 of the star anise in a medium stock pot or Dutch oven. Fill the pot with cold water (about 5 cups/1.25 L), or enough to cover the beef. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Skim away any foam from surface.
	3. Drain beef in a colander; discard the gingerroot slices and star anise. Rinse beef and the pot with cold water to remove any excess foam. Set aside separately to dry and let cool.
	4. Return pot to medium-high heat. Add oil and swirl to coat; add shallot, garlic to taste, cinnamon stick, reserved beef and remaining gingerroot slices and star anise. Cook, stirring, for 4 to 5 minutes until beef is lightly browned. Stir in Chinese five spice powder, Chinese cooking wine, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, dark soy sauce and Chu Hou paste. Cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes until the beef is coated with the sauce. Stir in salt, bay leaves, sugar, rehydrated chenpi and 3 cups (750 mL) water. Bring to a boil.
	5. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour, turning beef occasionally, and checking after 30 minutes to ensure there is enough water to prevent the meat from drying out. The liquid should have reduced to about half the original amount. If there isn’t enough liquid, add up to ½ cup (125 mL) water. 
	6. Stir in daikon and return to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes until beef and radish are tender.
	7. Stir 3 tbsp (45 mL) cold water into cornstarch in a small bowl, mixing until smooth. Gradually stir into the stew. Bring to a boil, stirring, Boil for 2 to 3 minutes or until sauce has thickened slightly. Discard bay leaves.
Recipe Tips:
  - Beef brisket or blade are the cuts most suited to this recipe. Try to pick out meat that has even marbling for optimal flavour and tenderness. If using lean meat with little marbling, reduce simmering time in step 4 by 30 minutes. Freeze the beef for 15 minutes before you cut the cubes to make it easier to cut.

Recipe Title: Barley Slaw
Recipe Summary: Barley turns a simple slaw into a hearty whole grain and veggie side dish that works well alongside beef sausages, a burger, roast beef or steak. The slaw can be enjoyed right after tossing it together but the standing time does help bring the flavours together and helps soften the vegetables slightly.

Recipe Title: Pan-Seared Shallot and Thyme Butter-Basted Steak
Recipe Summary: This steak gets cooked entirely on the stove top using the time-tested method of basting with a generous amount of butter (so worth it!) that results in a wonderful golden-brown crust. Nonstick skillets do not brown steak as well, so be sure to use a cast-iron or heavy stainless steel skillet. This steak is also known as a Porterhouse Grilling Steak and it has the same type of bone you find in a T-bone Steak.

	- 1 Beef Porterhouse T-bone Steaks, 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick (about 1¼ lb/675 g)
	- ¾ tsp (4 mL) salt 
	- ½ tsp (2 mL) fresh ground pepper
	- ½ cup (125 mL) butter
	- 2 shallots, halved
	- 4 sprigs fresh thyme
	- ¼ tsp (1 mL) coarse salt
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1 Beef Porterhouse T-bone Steaks, 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick (about 1¼ lb/675 g)
	- Salt
	- Fresh ground pepper
	- Butter
	- 2 shallots
	- 4 sprigs fresh thyme
	- Coarse salt
Recipe Methods:
	1. Pat steak dry with a paper towel and season all over with ¾ tsp (4 mL) salt and pepper. 
	 2. Heat a 9-inch (23 cm) cast-iron skillet or shallow heavy-bottomed stainless skillet over medium heat. Add butter, shallots and thyme, cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until butter is melted and starting to sizzle. 
	3. Push shallots and thyme to one side of pan; add steak. Cook, basting steak all over with butter often, for 4 to 5 minutes, or until steak is browned and releases easily from pan. Flip over and cook for 4 to 5 minutes more for 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick steak, or until nicely browned and digital instant-read thermometer inserted sideways into centre of steak reads 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare doneness at the least (or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done). 
	4. Transfer steak to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. Reserve pan drippings; keep warm. Discard shallots and thyme.
	5. Carve meat from bone, then across the grain into slices. Arrange steak and bone on a warmed platter and spoon drippings over steak. Sprinkle with coarse salt. 
Recipe Tips:
  - Tilt and rotate the skillet often, to help butter pool in one place so you can scoop it up to baste, and to promote even cooking during basting. Turn the range hood fan to HIGH to avoid setting off the smoke detector, and wear an apron while basting with butter, as the butter may splatter during cooking.

Recipe Title: Red Wine-Braised Beef Pot Roast in Potato Skins  
Recipe Summary: Canada Beef was a proud partner of Food & Drink’s 30th Anniversary Event where guests enjoyed this recipe, adapted from the original created by Christopher St. Onge for the Holiday 2017 issue of Food & Drink magazine (www.lcbo.com/foodanddrink). All the components of this knockout hors d’oeuvre can be made ahead of time – even the fried potato skins. Which, of course, means it’s party perfect. Frying in olive oil is a luxury here but common in Mediterranean countries where it is considerably cheaper than here. It does make for tasty potato skins, so it’s worth a go if you’re feeling flush.

	- Pepper
	- Bay leaf
	- All-purpose flour
	- Tomato paste
	- Red wine vinegar
	- Oil-packed anchovy fillets
	- Butter
	- Dry red wine
Recipe Methods:
	1. Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) of the oil with butter over medium heat in a Dutch oven or ovenproof pot with a tight-fitting lid. Cook onion and garlic, stirring often, for 3 minutes, until starting to soften. Stir in carrot, celery and rosemary; cook, stirring often, for 3 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Stir in flour and tomato paste. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and set aside.
	2. Wipe pot clean and return to high heat. Cut beef into 3 or 4 large chunks and pat dry with paper towel; season all over with salt and pepper to your taste. Add remaining 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil to pot; brown beef for about 6 minutes, turning to brown all sides. Pour in wine and broth; stir in reserved vegetable mixture. Boil for 1 minute or until thickened. Add bay leaf.
	3. Cover and bake in preheated 325°F (160°C) oven for 2½ hours or until meat is fork-tender.
	4. Meanwhile, prepare the potato halves by using a melon baller to scoop out most of the flesh, leaving a ¼-inch (5 mm) layer of potato next to the skin (reserve flesh for use in hash browns or another use). Heat a 2-inch (5 cm) depth of peanut oil over medium heat in a deep pot until it reaches 375°F (190°C) on a deep-fry/candy thermometer.

(Potato skins may be made up to 1 day in advance, covered and refrigerated until ready to warm and serve.)
	5. Once beef is tender, remove from braising liquid with slotted spoon, and transfer to cutting board. Discard bay leaf from liquid. Cut meat into ½-inch (1 cm) chunks. Return to liquid. (Beef can be cooked up to 3 days in advance; cover and refrigerated until ready to heat and serve.)
	6. Arugula Salsa Verde: Up to 2 hours before serving, combine arugula, oregano, vinegar, garlic, anchovies and oil in a food processor; pulse until the consistency of pesto, scraping down sides as necessary. Set aside.
	7. To serve, if necessary, reheat beef and sauce on stovetop over medium heat until warmed through. Heat potatoes on an unlined baking sheet in preheated 375 to 425°F (190 to 220°C) oven for about 1 minute, until warm. 
	8. Arrange potatoes on a serving platter, spoon meat and sauce into each potato and garnish with a small spoonful of Arugula Salsa Verde.

	- Chicken bouillon powder
	- Kansui (see Tip*)
	- 1 chenpi (dried mandarin peel)
	- Dried tofu skin
	- 1 can (approx 5 oz/150 g) sliced water chestnuts
Recipe Methods:
	1. Day 1: Combine ground beef, baking soda, salt and alkaline water in bowl of a stand mixer. Mix on medium speed with paddle attachment for 3 minutes. With mixer running on medium speed, gradually add 1¼ cups (300 mL) water, 1 tbsp (15 mL) at a time, mixing each addition until the water is fully absorbed into the beef. (To mix by hand, stir using a spatula for 10 minutes, adding 1¼ cups/300 mL water, 1 tbsp/15 mL at a time and mixing for 30 seconds before the next addition.) Cover and refrigerator overnight.
	2. Day 2: Combine chenpi (dried mandarin peel) in warm water in a small bowl and let soak for 15 minutes. 
	3. Meanwhile, place dried tofu skin in a heatproof bowl and add boiling water to cover. Let soak for 15 minutes.
	4. Drain chenpi, reserving ¾ cup (175 mL) soaking liquid. Finely dice chenpi and return to bowl with reserved soaking liquid. Add potato starch, sugar, chicken bouillon powder, white pepper and sesame oil and mix well.
	5. Return beef mixture to stand mixer bowl. Add beef fat, water chestnuts, cilantro and green onions. Mix on medium-low speed to combine. With mixer running on medium-low speed, gradually add in the chenpi mixture, 1 tbsp (15 mL) at a time, letting the beef absorb the liquid before adding more in. &nbsp;(To mix by hand, stir using a spatula chenpi mixture, 1 tbsp/15 mL at a time and mixing for 30 seconds before the next addition.)
	6. Scoop 2 tbsp (30 mL) of beef mixture (about the size of a small onion) and roll into a ball. Place on a plate. Repeat to make 21 balls total. Set aside.
	7. Drain tofu skin and place on a steamer basket in a single layer. Place 3 balls into the basket. Cover and steam on medium-high heat for 10 minutes until the beef is thoroughly cooked and “bouncy” in texture. Repeat with remaining balls, adding more water to steamer, as necessary between batches. Serve hot with Worcestershire for dipping.
Recipe Tips:
  - *Kansui is also know as food-grade lye water or alkaline water and is a traditional ingredient which helps tenderize and enhance the flavours of the beef. Bottled kansui is a solution of potassium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate and is available in Chinese or Japanese grocery stores. To make a homemade version, combine 1 tsp (5 mL) baking soda with 4 tsp (20 mL) water in a very small saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring, just to dissolve soda. Let cool completely. Store any extra in glass jar with lid in a cool area for up to 3 months. If you don’t want to cook all the meatballs at once, roll out the balls and freeze on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet until solid. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to enjoy them, remove from freezer and steam from frozen, increasing the cooking time for 12 minutes per batch.

	- Salt
	- Freshly ground black pepper
	- Olive oil
	- Carrots
	- 1 onion
	- Fresh rosemary and sage
	- Tomato paste

	- Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
	- Celery
Recipe Methods:
	1. Pat oxtail dry with paper towel. Season all over with salt and pepper. Heat oil over medium-high heat in Dutch oven or large heavy-bottom stockpot or saucepan. Sear oxtail, turning with tongs, for about 10 minutes or until browned all over. Transfer to a plate and tent with foil.
	2. Reduce heat to medium. Add carrots, celery, onion, rosemary, sage, tomato paste, anchovy paste and garlic to pot. Cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes or until softened. Stir in wine to deglaze pan, scraping up any browned bits and simmering until reduced by half. Add tomatoes, broth and bay leaves; bring to a boil.
	3. Return oxtail to pot along with any accumulated juices and Parmesan rind. Cover, reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 2 hours or until meat is very tender. During cooking, skim any pools of fat from surface of broth and discard. Add a splash of water to stew during the last hour of cooking if it begins to thicken too quickly. 
	4. Using tongs, transfer oxtail to a dish. Set aside until just cool enough to handle. Discard bay leaves and Parmesan rind. Simmer stew, partially covered and stirring often, for 15 minutes or until thickened. 
	5. Meanwhile, pull meat from oxtail; discard bones and trim. Tear meat into small pieces and stir into stew. Simmer for 5 minutes or until heated through. Remove from heat. Stir in parsley and vinegar. Serve with grated Parmesan, if desired. 
Recipe Tips:
  - Anchovy paste adds a unique richness, often referred to as umami. Using it in soups and stews brings out the full flavour of the other ingredients without tasting fishy. Look for it in the refrigerated section of the fish and seafood department.

Recipe Title: Pressure Cooker Braised Beef Birria
Recipe Summary: Beef Birria is a popular dish that can be served as a soup or in a taco. Guajillo chilies are not hot and you can add your own level of heat to your serving with serrano chilies or hot pepper sauce. To make tacos, the tortilla is dipped into the broth, filled with meat, and fried on both sides to crisp it slightly. You can skim the fat from the birria and use it for frying. The taco is then dipped in the broth as you eat it.

	- 6 whole cloves 
	- Cumin seeds
	- Whole black peppercorns
	- Olive oil
	- Onions
	- 6 cloves garlic

	- Salt
	- Cider vinegar (approx)
	- Beef broth
	- To serve (as desired): Fresh cilantro, serrano chilies or hot pepper sauce, lime, red onions, radishes, avocados, cabbage, tortillas
Recipe Methods:
	1. Snip off the stem end of each chili pepper with scissors and split each chili open lengthwise. Open up and scrape out seeds and membranes. Heat a heavy medium-size skillet over medium heat. To toast the chilies, place one or two in the pan skin side down and press it with a metal spatula until it softens and blisters. Flip the chili over and toast the inside being careful not to burn it. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and continue with the remaining chilies. Pour boiling water over chilies; set aside.
	2. To the same skillet, add cloves, cumin seeds and peppercorns and toast over low heat, shaking pan constantly, for about 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant. Transfer to a plate to cool. Grind the toasted spices finely in a mortar using a pestle or in a spice grinder. Set aside.
	3. Heat olive oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Cook onions and garlic, stirring frequently, for about 5 to 10 minutes or until the onions become translucent and turn lightly brown. Transfer to electric pressure cooker.
	4. Slice the meat in half lengthwise and cut each piece crosswise into 2-inch (5 cm) lengths. Add to pressure cooker; stir in tomatoes, oregano, cinnamon, bay leaves, vinegar, reserved ground toasted spices and 1 tsp (5 mL) salt.
	5. Drain the chilies and place in a blender with the beef stock; purée until smooth. Pour through a sieve directly over beef mixture, pressing down on the solids; discard solids. Seal the electric pressure cooker lid and make sure the vent is closed. Set the pressure to HIGH and time for 1 hour. When the timer beeps, let the pressure reduce naturally. Remove the lid and taste; adjust the seasoning to your taste with salt and vinegar. (The consistency should be in between a soup and a stew.)
	6. Serve in bowls as a stew or shred the meat and serve as tacos. Garnish with cilantro, serrano chilies or hot pepper sauce, lime wedges, onions, radishes, avocados, cabbage and tortillas as desired.
Recipe Tips:
  - To prepare on the stove-top, add ingredients to a large Dutch oven or enamelled cast-iron roaster instead of an electric pressure cooker. Add 2 cups (500 mL) additional beef broth. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cover and simmer over low heat for 3 hours, making sure the liquid covers the beef and adding more if necessary.

Recipe Title: Boiled beef with Dumplings
Recipe Summary: Indigenous people love to boil food and boiling beef is no exception. Mom always started by boiling roast cuts with parsley, carrots, thyme and root vegetables in a big pot of stew. Once the stew had set up, she would boil dumplings right in the stew. It was a classic staple in our household and we’d devour it on a cold winter night. This recipe technique actually goes against standard culinary training but it doesn’t matter to me as we’ve been cooking like this for hundreds of years.

Recipe Title: Barbecued Marinated Roast Beef
Recipe Summary: Vinaigrette salad dressing is a super-easy marinade and since it comes in so many varieties, you always have all kinds of flavour options right at your fingertips. Roast beef is so simple to cook in the barbecue by indirect heat roasting. Our time-test results are based on a roast that was about 8-in (20 cm) long x 5-in (12.5 cm wide) x 4-in (10 cm) deep. NOTE: ‘Time-to-cook’ figures are rough guidelines only as cook time is dependent on so many factors such as barbecue and thermometer accuracy, starting temperature of roast, roast shape and cut. A good thermometer is one of your best kitchen investments

Carefully transfer to a blender or to a tall, narrow pitcher or measuring cup and use an immersion blender; purée sauce until smooth. Stir in remaining butter; season with salt and pepper. 
		8. Carve roast across the grain into thin slices. Serve with roasted vegetables and Harvest Vegetable Sauce. 
Recipe Tips:
  - Eye of round is a very lean cut, so our recommendation is to cook no more than to medium doneness and to slice thinly. The shape of roast and cut are major factors in determining cooking time (as is the accuracy of your oven), so the best way to check the doneness of your oven roast is to use a meat thermometer. There are 2 basic types of meat thermometers. The programmable oven-safe digital models with a probe that you insert directly into the roast before placing in the oven and a read-out screen which allows you to monitor the temperature without continually opening the door. Digital instant-read meat thermometers are not oven-safe, so these are not inserted into the roast before cooking. Therefore, you must remove the roast from the oven and then insert the thermometer in the centre of roast to check for doneness.

Recipe Title: Egg and Veggie Fried Rice
Recipe Summary: Convenient packaged and frozen vegetables make the prep for this recipe even easier than going for take-out. Cold rice is key to making good fried rice–if it’s too warm and soft it will clump together and become mushy so plan ahead to cook it in the morning or the day before, or purchase a package of unflavoured pre-cooked rice. Serve with your favourite beef stir-fry or fast-fry steaks or simply slice up leftover roast beef and toss it in at the end to warm through.

	2. Heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Stir-fry onion for about 2 minutes or until softened. Add cauliflower rice, soy sauce and sesame oil; stir-fry for 2 minutes. Push vegetables to one side of the pan. Pour eggs into the cleared side of the pan. As eggs begin to set, gently move a spatula across bottom and sides of pan to form marble-sized, soft curds of egg. Cook for about 3 minutes or until eggs are thickened and no visible liquid egg remains.&nbsp;
	3. Add peas and carrots and cold rice to pan; gently mix into eggs and vegetables. Cook, gently folding with the spatula, for about 3 to 5 minutes or until rice is hot. Serve sprinkled with green onions.
Recipe Tips:
  - Cauliflower rice may also be labeled as “riced cauliflower” or “crumbled cauliflower”. Look for it in the packaged/prepared section of the produce department and in the frozen vegetable section. You can make your own by finely chopping fresh cauliflower with a large chef’s knife, grating on the medium or large holes of a box grater or by using short pulses in a food processor (just be careful not to purée it!).

	5. Meanwhile, heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Add butter and 2 tsp (10 mL) oil and let butter melt. Add potato mixture, spreading into an even layer to make 1 pancake. Reduce heat to medium-low and let cook for about 8 minutes or until bottom is well browned and crisp. 
	6. Invert a plate over potato pancake and, wearing oven mitts, carefully flip out onto plate. Slide back into skillet with the uncooked side down. Cook for about 8 minutes longer or until potatoes are tender and bottom is well browned and crisp.
	7. Transfer Potato Pancake to a cutting board; cut in half or quarters. Place on serving plates and top with steaks. Spoon Salsa Verde on top and garnish with radish, avocado, arugula and tomatoes. 
Recipe Tips:
  - For the potato pancake, oblong baking potatoes, such as russet, or yellow-fleshed potatoes work best (avoid waxy new potatoes). You’ll need about 3 medium (1 lb/500 g); use the coarse side of a box cheese grater to grate them. It’s important to squeeze out the liquid to ensure the pancake holds together and you get a crisp, golden brown cake.

Recipe Title: Sous Vide Beer-braised Beef Stew
Recipe Summary: Convenient cubes of beef cook to perfect tenderness in a beer-laced broth; the beef remains a little pink inside which keeps the meat juicy. Look for well marbled beef for the best flavour and texture in this stew. The natural juices of the beef and aromatic vegetables are all you need for a deep flavour. The resulting broth is thinner than a typical stew and is best served over creamy mashed potatoes or egg noodles. The stew can be served directly from the sous vide though it’s not as hot as a typical stew, so a quick heat-up in the saucepan just before serving will bring it up to steaming.

Recipe Ingredients List:
	- 3 Beef Cheeks (about 2 lb/1 kg)
	- 1 cup (250 mL) coarse sea salt 
	- 3 cloves garlic, minced
	- 10 fresh sage leaves, roughly chopped
	- 4 tbsp (60 mL) bacon fat or beef tallow (approx)
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 3  Beef Cheeks  (about 2 lb/1 kg)
	- Coarse sea salt
	- 3 cloves garlic
	- 10 fresh sage leaves
	- Bacon fat or beef tallow
Recipe Methods:
	1. Trim fat and any silver skin from the beef cheeks. Place on a platter. Combine salt, garlic and sage in a bowl. Spread salt mixture all over beef to heavily coat. Refrigerate, uncovered, for 3 hours.
	2. Set up water bath for sous vide and preheat to 185°F (85°C) according to manufacturer’s directions.
	3. Rinse the salt mixture from the beef and pat dry with paper towel. Place 1 cheek in its own vacuum seal bag; add 1 tbsp (15 mL) bacon fat per bag. Remove as much air as possible and seal bags using vacuum sealer.
	 4. Immerse bags in preheated water bath and secure to the side of the pot with a clip, keeping the top of the bags above the surface of the water. Cover water bath with foil or plastic to reduce evaporation. Cook sous vide for 12 hours.
	5. Remove each cheek from its bag, discarding liquid. Pat beef dry with paper towel. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. Add just enough of the remaining bacon fat to coat the skillet. Add beef cheeks and sear for about 30 seconds per side, turning once, until browned. Cut each in half to serve. 
Recipe Tips:
  - Cooking sous vide at this high temperature causes the water to evaporate during the cooking process. Cover your cooking container with foil to reduce evaporation and check level often, replenishing with hot water, as necessary.

Recipe Tips:
  - Use a digital instant-read thermometer to best judge if sausage is done. Cutting sausages open to check for doneness reduces the juiciness of sausages and is not a true way to test doneness.

	- Salt and pepper
	-  Gremolata
	- ¼ cup (60 mL) finely chopped fresh parsley	
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) minced garlic
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 12 pieces  Beef Marrow Bones, Cross-cut,2 inches (5 cm) thick
	- Olive oil
	- Extra-virgin olive oil
	- Onion
	- Carrot
	- Celery
	- Fresh parsley
	- Garlic
	- 1 lemon	
	- 2 bay leaves	
	- 1 cup (250 mL) strained tomatoes (passata)
	- Beef broth
	- Salt and pepper
	- Fresh parsley
Recipe Methods:
	1. To prepare marrow bones, with the back of a sturdy knife, scrape off any meat clinging to the outside of the bones. In a large container or nonreactive bowl, stir 3 tbsp (45 mL) salt and 4 quarts (4 L) water together until salt is dissolved. Add the marrow bones, cover and refrigerate overnight or for 24 hours. Drain bones well. 
	2. Sauce: Heat oil over medium heat in a large Dutch oven or enamelled cast-iron roaster. Add onion, carrot, celery, and parsley and sauté until the vegetables are soft but not browned, 8 to 10 minutes.
	 3. Meanwhile, using a vegetable peeler, peel 2 strips of the yellow zest (avoiding the white pith) from lemon. Finely grate 4 tsp (20 mL) zest and set aside for the gremolata (wrap and refrigerate if making sauce ahead). Reserve remaining lemon for another use.
	 4. Add strips of lemon zest, garlic, bay leaves, tomatoes, wine and broth to pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 1½ hours or until reduced by two-thirds and thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat. (Make ahead: The sauce may be prepared up to 2 days in advance. Let cool, cover and refrigerate.)
	5. Gremolata: When ready to serve, combine the grated lemon zest, parsley and garlic in a small bowl and set aside.
	6. Place the marrow bones 2 inches (5 cm) apart on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Brush bones lightly with oil and season lightly with salt and pepper. Bake in preheated 350ºF for 15 minutes. Reheat the sauce in a saucepan over medium heat until simmering while the bones are roasting. 
	7. Spoon sauce on 4 heated plates and place 3 marrow bones on each. Sprinkle with the gremolata and serve immediately.
Recipe Tips:
  - When preparing the Marrow Bones, the soaking step helps firm up the marrow and helps it be a creamy white. Scraping helps make the bones look more attractive. You can skip this step if you prefer.

Recipe Title: Smoker-Style Barbecued Beef Roast with Herb Mop
Recipe Summary: With a few steps and just a few basic ingredients, you can make this subtly smoked Beef Brisket without a smoker! You can skip the Herb Mop and simply add 2 tbsp (30 mL) each chopped fresh rosemary, thyme and oregano leaves to the vinegar sauce. Adding wood chips to the barbecue won’t produce the same intense flavour as a smoker and the brisket won’t achieve the coveted smoke ring but it will have a great crust and will be beautifully tender. For the strongest smoke flavour, select a hard wood, such as hickory or mesquite.

	- Wood chips, such as hickory or mesquite, soaked according to package directions 
	- Herb Mop
		- 1 small bunch rosemary sprigs
		- 1 small bunch thyme sprigs
		- 1 small bunch oregano sprigs
		- 1 stick, twig or old wooden spoon
		- Butcher’s twine
	- Smoked Brisket
		- 1 cup (250 mL) EACH white vinegar and cider vinegar
		- 2 tbsp (30 mL) EACH packed brown sugar and ketchup 
		- 2 tbsp (30 mL) hot pepper sauce, such as Frank’s
		- 1 tsp (5 mL) EACH dry mustard, garlic powder and onion powder
		- 4 lb (2 kg) Beef Brisket, Point Portion (Pot Roast)
		- 1½ tsp (7 mL) EACH salt and fresh ground pepper
Recipe Shopping List:
	- Wood chips, such as hickory or mesquite
	- 1 small bunch rosemary sprigs
	- 1 small bunch thyme sprigs
	- 1 small bunch oregano sprigs
	- 1 stick, twig or old wooden spoon
	- Butcher’s twine
	- White vinegar
	- Cider vinegar
	- Brown sugar
	- Ketchup
	- Hot pepper sauce, such as Frank’s
	- Dry mustard
	- 4 lb (2 kg) Beef Brisket, Point Portion (Pot Roast)
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper
	- Garlic powder
	- Onion powder
Recipe Methods:
	1. Fill drip pan part way with water and place under grill (off to one side). Preheat barbecue to medium-high (400°F/200°C). Turn off burner under drip pan.
	2. Add soaked wood chips to smoker box. Alternatively, wrap 2 cups (5 oz/150 g) wood chips loosely in foil to create a small pouch, punching a few holes at the top of the pouch to let the smoke out. Place smoker box or pouch on the grill grate above the burner that is turned on for 10 to 20 minutes, or until starting to smoke.
	Herb Mop: : 
		3. Meanwhile, arrange rosemary, thyme and oregano sprigs together like a bouquet of flowers. Attach to the end of a stick, twig or wooden spoon by tying together with butcher’s twine to make a broom handle or the herb “mop”; set aside.
	Smoked Brisket: : 
		4. Combine white vinegar, cider vinegar, sugar, ketchup, hot pepper sauce, mustard, garlic powder and onion powder in a medium bowl; set aside for basting. Pat beef dry with paper towel. Season all over with salt and pepper. 
		5. Place roast on grill over drip pan (off the heat). Insert an oven-safe meat thermometer sideways into centre of roast, avoiding fat.
		 6. Close lid and cook for 2 hours. Flip roast and baste with vinegar sauce using herb mop. Repeat flipping and basting every 2 hours, for 8 to 10 hours total cooking time until meat is fork-tender and thermometer reads between 200°F (93°C) and 205°F (96°C).
		7. Transfer brisket to a cutting board, cover with foil and let rest for at least 15 minutes.
		 8. Carve roast across the grain into thin slices. 
Recipe Tips:
  - Avoid lifting the barbecue lid to ‘peek’ at the brisket between mopping intervals. For best flavour and tenderness, you want to keep the smoke inside and maintain an even temperature. When flipping and basting, work quickly and close the lid as soon possible. Let your brisket stand at least 15 minutes before carving to allow the juices to settle. Serve with your favourite barbecue sauce on the side, if desired. Leftover brisket will develop a smokier flavour the next day.

Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1  Beef Kidney (about 1 lb/500 g) 
	- Salt
	- Vegetable oil
	- 2 lb (1 kg) Boneless Beef Blade Simmering Steak, cut into 1-inch (2.5 cm) cubes
	- Unsalted butter
	- Onion
	- Celery
	- 2 cloves garlic
	- All-purpose flour
	- Dry red wine

	- Bay leaves
	- Worcestershire sauce
	- Carrots
	- Small mushrooms
	- Pie pastry for double-crust 9-inch (23 cm) pie (homemade or store-bought)
	- 1 egg
Recipe Methods:
	1. Cut the beef kidney in half lengthwise. Trim out any fat and membranes. Cut kidney into ¼-inch (5 mm) thick slices. Place 1 tbsp (15 mL) salt and 4 cups (1 l) water in a medium pot. Add the kidney and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat and let sit for 15 minutes. Drain and rinse under cool water, removing any scum. Cover and refrigerate while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
	2. Season blade steak with salt to your taste. Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil over high heat in a Dutch oven or enamelled cast-iron roaster. Add beef, in 2 batches, and cook until browned on all sides. Transfer to a plate. Add 1 tbsp (15 mL) more oil to pot between batches. 
	 3. Add butter to pot and melt over medium heat. Cook onion, celery and garlic, stirring occasionally, for 4 to 5 minutes or until lightly browned. Sprinkle in flour and stir well (the mixture will be dry). Gradually whisk in the wine. Whisk in the broth and bring to a boil. Stir in beef and any accumulated juices, kidney, thyme, bay leaves, Worcestershire sauce and ½ tsp (2 mL) salt.
	4. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 2½ to 3 hours, adding carrots for the last 30 minutes, until the kidney and beef are fork-tender. Discard thyme stems and bay leaves.
	 5. Heat remaining 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil over medium high heat in a large skillet. Cook mushrooms, stirring, for 4 to 5 minutes or until they start to brown around the edges. Stir into beef mixture. Transfer to an 11 by 7-inch (28 x 17.5 cm) baking dish.
	 6. Roll the pastry on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle that is 1 inch (2.5 cm) larger than the dimensions of the baking dish. Drape the pastry evenly over the dish and fold the overhang under, crimping it around the edge. With a small sharp knife, cut 4 V-shaped vents down the middle of the pastry. Brush the pastry with the egg yolk mixture.
	 7. Place dish on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet to catch any drips. Bake in preheated 400ºF oven for 30 to 40 minutes until the pastry is golden brown. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
Recipe Tips:
  - While the filling simmers in step 4, check the level of the liquid. It should be reduced to a medium-thick sauce by the end of cooking; add splashes of water if it’s reducing too quickly. If the sauce is too thin at the end of cooking, uncover and cook over medium heat until it thickens.

Wrap each beef slice around 2 asparagus spears and 1 red pepper strip, overlapping the meat slightly; discard any excess marinade. Secure the rolls with metal picks or soaked wooden toothpicks.
	3. Grill beef rolls, on lightly oiled grill over medium-high heat, for 3 to 4 minutes, basting with remaining oil mixture and turning often, until heated through, well-marked and cooked to preferred doneness.
Recipe Tips:
  - Purchasing the centre-cut of tenderloin, rather than the tapered ends, will ensure all beef slices are the same diameter and size for uniform bundle

	- Bean sprouts
	- Lime wedges
	- Thinly sliced Thai chilies
	- Shallots
	- Pickled sour mustard greens (haam choy)
Recipe Methods:
	1. Trim excess fat from the meat to your taste. Starting at the thicker end of each piece of meat, make a cut in between the meat and the fibrous silverskin, lifting the fat and silverskin away from the meat while you trim along the strip of meat. (Tip: Grip the silverskin with a paper towel to prevent slipping.). Discard the trim. Cut the meat crosswise into 1½-inch (4 cm) pieces.
	2. Place meat in an electric pressure cooker. Add 2 cups (500 mL) water, lemongrass, galangal, lime leaves, shallots and garlic. Seal the pressure cooker lid and make sure the vent is closed. Set the pressure to HIGH and time for 20 minutes
	 3. When the timer beeps, quick release the pressure. Drain through a large sieve or colander into a bowl; reserve the liquid. Return the beef to the liquid and discard remaining solids.
	4. Clean and dry pressure cooker insert and return to cooker. Set cooker to Medium/Normal Sauté/Sear and add 1 tbsp (15 mL) vegetable oil. When the oil is hot, add the ginger; cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add curry paste; cook, stirring, for 2 minutes until fragrant. Stir in curry powder until blended, then stir in coconut milk, sugar, tamarind, reserved liquid and beef. Simmer, uncovered and stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, until flavours are blended. Taste and adjust the seasoning with sugar, tamarind and fish sauce, as desired (depending on the curry paste, you may not need the fish sauce).
	5. Meanwhile, heat 1 inch (2.5 cm) of vegetable in a skillet to 350ºF. Remove 1/6 of the noodles from the package and loosen them up. Shape into 4 nests and slide into the oil. Cook, for about 1 minute, turning once, until crisp. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towel to drain (don’t worry if they’ve lost their nest shape). Set aside.
	 6. Just before serving, cook remaining noodles in a large pot of boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes or until tender. Drain quickly and divide among 4 serving bowls. Ladle the meat and sauce over the noodles, top with a fried noodle nest and serve immediately with the desired garnishes.
Recipe Tips:
  - To cook on a stove-top, proceed with Step 2 using a Dutch oven or enamelled cast-iron roaster; increase the water to 4 cups (1 L), and simmer, covered, for 1½ hours, until meat is tender and liquid is reduced by half. If there is too much liquid, boil, uncovered, over high heat until reduced or add water if sauce is too thick. Continue with the recipe directed.

Recipe Methods:
	1. Cook ground beef, onion, green pepper and garlic over medium-high heat in a Dutch oven or large saucepan, stirring and using back of spoon to break up beef into chunks, for 8 to 10 minutes until meat is thoroughly cooked and vegetables are softened. Drain, if needed. 
	2. Stir in salt, oregano, basil, pepper, sugar, tomato sauce, stewed tomatoes, beef broth, tomato paste and Worcestershire sauce; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 to 20 minutes, until flavours blend.
	 3. Garlic Texas Toast Crumb: Meanwhile, cut slices of Furlani Garlic Texas Toast into ½-inch (1 cm) cubes. Arrange in a single layer on parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Bake in preheated 350°F oven, stirring twice or more, for 18 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy all the way through. Let cool to room temperature. Fold parchment paper over cubes and crush into crumbs using the bottom of a skillet or palm of your hand. Measure out 3 tbsp (45 mL) for topping, reserving extra for another use (see Tip); set aside. 
	4. Stir macaroni into beef mixture, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, for 20 minutes or until pasta is cooked to al dente. Meanwhile, bake the Furlani Garlic Texas Toast according to package directions.
	5. Remove pasta mixture from heat and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve garnished with fresh chopped parsley (if using) and Garlic Texas Toast Crumb. Serve with slices of toasted Furlani Garlic Texas Toast.
Recipe Tips:
  - Tips: Use Garlic Texas Toast Crumb to top pasta dishes or in your favourite beef burgers, meatballs or meat loaves instead of purchased dry breadcrumbs. Turn this dish into a goulash, by adding 2 tbsp (30 mL) sweet paprika with the dried herbs. For a spicy southwest version, just add 1 to 2 tbsp (15 to 30 mL) chili powder with the dried herbs and 1 cup (250 mL) drained corn kernels (thawed frozen or canned) when adding the macaroni. Looking for a faster cooking option? Cook the pasta separately while you are simmering the sauce! Here’s how: proceed with the recipe but omit the beef broth; after 20 minutes of simmering the sauce, stir in drained cooked pasta, heat through and serve.

Recipe Title: Marinated Barbecued Asian-Style Roast with Salsa 
Recipe Summary: This recipe is the perfect way to enjoy roast beef in the summertime. As the glaze is prone to charring, use for roasts sized at 3 lb (1.5 kg) at the most. Our time-test results are based on a roast that was about 7½-in (19 cm) long x 5-in (12.5 cm wide) x 3-in (7.5 cm) deep. NOTE: ‘Time-to-cook’ figures are rough guidelines only as cook time is dependent on so many factors such as: barbecue and thermometer accuracy, starting temperature of roast, roast shape and cut. A good thermometer is one of your best kitchen investments.

	- 1/2 tsp (2 mL) EACH salt and pepper, divided
	- 2 tsp (10 mL) red wine vinegar
	- 1/2 cup (125 mL) all-purpose flour
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) vegetable oil
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1 lb (500 g) sliced Beef or Veal Liver, about ¼ inch (5 mm) thick
	- 2 slices thick-cut bacon
	- 1 Vidalia or Spanish onion
	- Fresh thyme leaves (or dried thyme)
	- Salt and pepper
	- Red wine vinegar
	- All-purpose flour
	- Vegetable oil
Recipe Methods:
	1. Scatter bacon in a large nonstick skillet set over medium heat. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until crisp. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Set aside.  
	2. Add onion and thyme to skillet. Sprinkle with 1/4 tsp (1 mL) each salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until softened. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring often, for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown and very soft. If pan is gets too dry, add a splash of water to prevent scorching. Stir in vinegar and crisp bacon. Transfer to a plate; keep warm. 
	3. Meanwhile, cut liver slices into 1-inch (2.5 cm) wide strips; pat dry with paper towel. Arrange liver in a single layer on a large plate. Stir flour with remaining salt and pepper; sprinkle over liver. Toss gently to coat. 
	4. Heat oil in the same skillet set over medium-high heat. Cook liver, in batches and turning pieces halfway through cooking, for 5 to 6 minutes or until evenly browned on the outside and still slightly pink on the inside. (Liver is best when cooked to medium doneness, at most.)
	5. Arrange cooked liver on a shallow platter. Top with warm onions and bacon. Serve immediately. 
Recipe Tips:
  - Beef liver can have a stronger flavour and aroma than calf’s liver, although not necessarily so. One method to mellow the flavour is by soaking the beef liver in milk, in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Drain and discard milk, then pat liver dry before coating with flour.

Recipe Title: Tomato & Wine Sous Vide-braised Beef Osso Buco
Recipe Summary: Thick slices of beef shank with traditional flavours cooked in an untraditional way will make you glad you discovered sous vide! The rich flavour of the beef with the aromatic tomato sauce makes a perfect match and the long, slow cooking tenderizes the beef beautifully. This even keeps the beef a touch pink inside and you won’t believe the melt-in-your-mouth tenderness as a result. It does take more than a full day to cook but with a simple finish just before serving and the make-ahead option (see Tip), this is the perfect entertaining dish to dazzle guests. Serve with Parmesan risotto, pasta or gnocchi and tender-crisp green beans.

	- Chopped fresh parsley (optional)
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 4 slices  Beef Centre Cut Shank,  1½ inches (4 cm) thick (about 1 lb/500 g each)
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper

Recipe Methods:
	1. Set up water bath for sous vide and preheat to 158°F (70°C) according to manufacturer’s directions.
	 2. Pat beef dry with paper towel and season all over with ½ tsp (2 mL) salt and ¼ tsp (1 mL) pepper. Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Brown beef, in batches, for about 4 minutes, turning once, until browned on both sides. Transfer to a plate and set aside. Add more oil to pan between batches, as necessary.
	3. Reduce heat to medium-low and a little oil, if necessary to make a thin layer. Add carrots and onion; cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes or until softened. Add garlic, rosemary and ¼ tsp (1 mL) each salt and pepper; cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add wine and cook, stirring and scraping up brown bits from pan. Remove from heat, stir in tomatoes. 
	 4. Place 2 slices beef in each of 2 large bags for sous vide (vacuum, sealable freezer or reusable silicone). Pour half of tomato mixture into each bag (about 1¾ cups/425 mL per bag). Arrange beef slices in a single layer in bags. Remove as much air as possible and vacuum or manually seal. 
	 5. Immerse bags in preheated water bath and secure to the side of the pot with a clip, keeping the top of the bag above the surface of the water. Cover water bath with foil or plastic to reduce evaporation. Cook sous vide for 28 hours, replenishing water as necessary.
	6. Remove beef from water bath. Transfer beef from bag with a slotted spoon to warmed serving dishes. Tent with foil and keep warm.
	7. Pour sauce into a medium saucepan and skim off fat. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce heat and boil for about 10 minutes or until slightly reduced. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide bones and meat between 4 serving dishes, breaking meat into chunks if some slices of shank are meatier than others. Pour hot sauce over beef and garnish with parsley, if desired.
Recipe Tips:
  - The flavour improves even more when made ahead. To make ahead, after removing from water bath, immerse beef in sauce in bags in a sink or bowl of ice water and chill, replenishing ice as necessary until cold. Refrigerate in bags for up to 3 days. To serve, reheat in the bags in a 158°F (70°C) water bath for 1 hour or in a large, wide saucepan over medium heat simmering beef in the sauce until hot.

	- 2 sprigs fresh thyme (or ¼ tsp/1 mL dried)
	- 1 small sprig fresh rosemary
	- 1 bay leaf 
Recipe Shopping List:
	- Dried porcini mushrooms (1 oz 30 g)
	- 4 whole small-sized  Beef Digital Flexor Meat  (EACH about 10 to 12 oz/300 to 375 g)
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper

	- Beef broth
	- Tomato paste
	- 2 sprigs fresh thyme (or ¼ tsp/1 mL dried)
	- 1 small sprig fresh rosemary
	- 1 bay leaf 
Recipe Methods:
	1. Place the porcini mushrooms in a heatproof bowl and pour in boiling water. Let soak while preparing the remaining ingredients.
	 2. Season the meat all over with salt and pepper to your taste. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a Dutch oven or large enamelled cast-iron roaster with a tight-fitting lid. Add beef and cook, turning with tongs, until browned on all sides (it will curl while cooking and this is fine). Transfer to a plate.
	  3. Add onion, carrot, celery, garlic and parsley to the pot and reduce heat low. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 5 to 6 minutes or until the vegetables soften and start to brown. Add the wine and bring to a boil, scraping up brown bits stuck to pot. Return meat and any accumulated juices to pot. Stir in broth, tomato paste, thyme, rosemary bay leaf and ½ tsp (2 mL). 
	 4. Strain the porcini mushrooms, reserving the liquid. Coarsely chop the mushrooms and add to the pot. Carefully pour the mushroom water into the pot leaving any sediment behind. Cover with the lid and cook in preheated 300ºF oven for 2 hours, check every hour to ensure that the liquid comes halfway up the beef and adding water, if needed to maintain that level. Turn beef over, cover and cook for about 1 hour longer or until beef is fork-tender and the sauce lightly thickened. 
	5. Transfer beef to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. Strain the vegetables out of the liquid, if desired, or leave them in the sauce. Discard herb stems and bay leaf. Slice each piece of beef across the grain into 1-inch (2.5 cm) thick slices and spoon sauce over to serve. 
Recipe Tips:
  - The pot roasts can be braised on top of the stovetop for the same amount of time, maintaining a gentle simmer, or in an electric pressure cooker on HIGH pressure for 1 hour with a natural release. Reduce the beef broth to 1 cup (250 ml) if using pressure cooker.

Recipe Title: Garlic-Studded Oven Roast with Simple Pan Sauce
Recipe Summary: In this recipe, simple seasoning highlights the rich flavour of roast beef and adds depth to the simple pan gravy. The shape of the roast has as much to do with the cook time as the size and the cut. Our time-test results are based on a 3-rib roast that was about 7-in (18 cm) long x 6-in (15 cm) wide x 3-in (8 cm) deep. NOTE: ‘Time-to-cook’ figures are rough guidelines only as cook time is dependent on so many factors such as: oven and thermometer accuracy, starting temperature of roast, roast shape and cut. A good thermometer is one of your best kitchen investments

Recipe Methods:
	1. Salsa: Whisk together oil, vinegar, sugar and salt in a medium bowl until dissolved. Add tomatoes, shallot and parsley; toss to coat. Let stand at room temperature until ready to serve.
	 2. Rice and Beef: Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Crumble up beef burgers and add to pan. Stir in cumin, salt, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, ginger, coriander and garlic. Cook, breaking up into small crumbles, for 5 to 7 minutes or until browned.
	 3. Stir in rice until well combined. Add 3 cups (750 mL) water and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes or until liquid is absorbed. 
	4. Wilted Greens: Meanwhile, heat oil with garlic over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add kale and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes or until wilted.
	5. Remove rice mixture from heat and stir in beans. Let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Serve over wilted greens and top with Salsa.
Recipe Tips:
  - Seeding the tomatoes makes the salsa less watery and thus, more flavourful. Here’s how: cut the tomatoes in half crosswise. Working over the sink or a bowl, use your fingers or a spoon to pull out the seeds from the seed cavities. Let tomatoes sit cut-side down on paper towel for 5 to 10 minutes to allow juice to drain.

Recipe Title: Barbecue Smoked Beef Roast
Recipe Summary: Earn your barbecue badge of honour by making smoked brisket – without even investing in a smoker! Whether done in propane or gas or charcoal kettle barbecue, settle in for a low temperature, slow roast that lets a subtle smoky flavour and tenderness to develop. Follow the steps below for perfection. If you prefer a smaller roast, use a 4 lb (2 kg) Flat/First Cut section or Double/Point End/Deckle section and reduce the rub ingredients by half. If cooking the thinner Flat/First Cut, reduce the cooking time in step 5 to about 2 to 2¼ hours.

Recipe Ingredients List:
	- 1 Beef Brisket Pot Roast , 8 to 10 lb (3.5 to 4.5 kg) 
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) coarsely ground black pepper 
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) granulated onion 
	- 4 tsp (20 mL) granulated garlic 
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) dry mustard 
	- 4 tsp (20 mL) Kosher salt 
	- 4 tsp (20 mL) packed brown sugar 
	- 4 tsp (20 mL) smoked paprika 
	- 4 tsp (20 mL) sweet paprika 
	- Hardwood chips
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1 Beef Brisket Pot Roast , 8 to 10 lb (3.5 to 4.5 kg) 
	- Coarsely ground black pepper
	- Granulated onion
	- Granulated garlic
	- Dry mustard
	- Kosher salt
	- Brown sugar
	- Smoked paprika
	- Sweet paprika
	- Hardwood chips
Recipe Methods:
	FOR THE BRISKET:
	1. Trim brisket, leaving ¼ inch (5 mm) fat cap on top, and make two ¾-inch (2 cm) deep scores across the grain of meat on one side of the flat at ½- to ¾-inch (1 to 2 cm) intervals. This will help make sure you slice it properly after the brisket is cooked (and you can’t see the grains as easily).
	 2. Combine salt, pepper, granulated garlic, granulated onion, sugar, smoked paprika, sweet paprika and dry mustard in a bowl. Season the brisket heavily, pressing the rub into the meat. Wrap brisket in plastic wrap, place on a baking sheet or tray and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or for up to 12 hours.
	TO USE A KETTLE BBQ:
	 1. Remove the top grill off the barbecue, and place an empty basket in the corner of the base. Fill one-third of the basket with cold charcoal, leaving room for the hot coals. Get a smaller amount of charcoal white hot in a chimney starter, then place them in the one-third space left in the basket. The heat will slowly “snake” across the rest of the charcoal.
	2. Soak 2 cups (500 mL) wood chips in water for at least 15 minutes. Drain off water; scatter the soaked chips over the charcoal. Alternately you can use large chunks of barbecue wood (such as hickory, mesquite, etc) without soaking.
	3. Place a small foil pan next to the basket and fill it with hot water.
	 4. Fill a large foil drip pan with ½ inch (1 cm) water and place on base underneath where the brisket will go, then replace the top grill back on the barbecue. Close the lid, making sure the vent holes are on the opposite side of the charcoal (this will direct the heat and smoke to go over the brisket side of the barbecue), and preheat to 250°F. Soak more wood chips for replenishing as you cook.
	TO USE A PROPANE/GAS BARBECUE:
	1. Soak 2 cups (500 mL) wood chips in water for at least 15 minutes. Drain off water and place wood chips in the smoke box (if your barbecue is equipped), or wrap in a square of foil in a package the size of a deck of cards and poke holes in packet to let smoke escape; place wood chip pack under grill (off to one side), directly on top of the burners. 
	2. Place a small foil pan under the grill next to the wood chips; fill it with hot water. 
	3. Fill a large foil drip pan with ½ inch (1 cm) water and place under the grill, on opposite the side of the barbecue from the wood chips (or over the burner furthest from the smoke box). Heat the side of the barbecue under the wood chips (or closest to smoke box) to low. Close the lid and pre-heat the grill on medium-low to 250°F. Soak more wood chips for replenishing as you cook.
	TO COOK:
	1. Unwrap brisket. Place brisket on grill over the drip pan, fat cap up. Insert oven-safe digital meat thermometer into centre of roast. Close the lid and cook for 2 hours. Check the brisket. If it looks dry, brush or spray those areas with water to keep it moist. Rotate the brisket for even cooking. Add more wood chips if needed to maintain smoke.
	 2. Cook for 2 hours longer or until thermometer registers 140°F (60°C). Carefully lift brisket onto a large piece foil, keeping the fat cap up, and wrap into a packet, sealing around edges (this will steam the brisket, which will speed up the cooking time and keep the brisket moist). 
	 3. Return the wrapped brisket to barbecue, close lid, and cook for 3 hours longer (for a total of 7 hours) until thermometer registers 180 to 200°F (82 to 93°C), and meat is tender in both the point (double) and the flat (single) sections. Check the tenderness by sliding a skewer (or thermometer) through the foil until there is zero resistance and meat feels very tender.
	 4. Transfer brisket to cutting board, open foil wrap and let rest for 20 to 30 minutes, or until roast has cooled 140°F (60°C). Carve across the grain into thin slices.
Recipe Tips:
  - When moistening the brisket while cooking, a spray bottle works best to avoid removing the rub but you can use a mop, a pastry brush, or even just a paper towel dipped in water instead.

Recipe Title: Sous Vide Beef Meatballs with Yogurt Greek Salad in Pitas
Recipe Summary: An interesting aspect of sous vide is the long cooking time at a steady temperature allows the ground beef to cook safely even though the temperature is lower than conventional heat methods. This technique keeps the meatballs moist and tender and is surprisingly easy to do. These Greek-inspired meatballs can be served in pitas with salad as we have here, or on their own with your favourite side dishes and the bonus is you can make them ahead, too.

Recipe Shopping List:
	- Carrots and parsnips
	- Butternut squash
	- Sweet potato
	- Olive oil
	- Fresh rosemary
	- Sweet red and green pepper
	- 2 slices bacon
	- 1 lb (500 g) Boneless Beef Blade Simmering Steak (or 1¼ lb/625 g Bone-in), 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper
	- 2 medium onions
	- 2 cloves garlic
	- Dried thyme
	- Beef broth
	- Balsamic vinegar
	- 2 bay leaves
	- Cornstarch
Recipe Methods:
	1. Roasted Vegetables: Combine carrots, parsnips, squash and sweet potato in a large bowl. Add balsamic vinegar, olive oil, rosemary and ¼ tsp (1 mL) each salt and pepper; toss to coat. Spread in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet or shallow roasting pan and roast in bottom third of 425°F oven for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325°F and continue roasting vegetables for about 1 hour.
	2. Braised Beef: Meanwhile, cook bacon in a Dutch oven or sauté pan with lid over medium-high heat, stirring, for about 5 minutes or until crisp; transfer bacon to a bowl and set aside.
	3. Cut steak into 4 equal pieces and pat dry with paper towel. Season all over with salt and pepper to your taste. Add to bacon drippings in pot and brown for 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to bowl with bacon and set aside. Reduce heat to medium and add onions, garlic and thyme to pot; cook, stirring occasionally, for about 8 minutes or until onions are soft and golden brown. Stir in 2 tbsp (30 mL) of vinegar, scraping up brown bits stuck to pot.
	4. Stir in broth and bay leaves; bring to a simmer. Return bacon and steaks with accumulated juice to pan; cover and simmer in oven on rack above vegetables for about 1¼ hours or until meat is fork tender. 
	5. Stir red and green peppers into vegetables and roast for about 15 minutes until vegetables are browned and tender. Remove vegetables from the oven and keep warm if they’re tender before beef is ready. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
	6. Transfer steaks to cutting board. Return pot of sauce to medium heat on the stove top and return to a simmer. Stir cornstarch with remaining 1 tbsp (15 mL) vinegar and stir into pot. Boil, stirring, for about 2 minutes or until thickened and glossy. Discard bay leaves. Season sauce with salt and pepper to taste. Slice steaks across the grain and serve with sauce and roasted vegetables.
Recipe Tips:
  - If a blade steak is not available, buy a boneless blade roast and cut crosswise into 1-inch (2.5 cm) slices, discarding string (you can freeze extra for another use). Once untied, the slices will separate into smaller pieces so you may have more than 4 and can skip slicing steaks before serving.

Recipe Title: Slow-Roasted Thick Steak with Tahini Sauce and Greens
Recipe Summary: This recipe is a whole new vision for beef: a thick juicy steak that’s carved and passed family style at the table along with garden greens and veggies, nuts, and seeds is like having a power-bowl, without the bowl. Serve with this something other than gravy (like the Tahini Sauce here) and a whole grain, like a farro or barley to complete the power-bowl experience.

	- Cucumber
	- Seeds/nuts, such as toasted pumpkin, sunflower or sliced almonds 
	- Fresh cilantro sprigs
	- Salt
	- Dijon mustard
Recipe Methods:
	1. Pat steak dry with paper towel. Season meat all over with steak spice; just enough to coat but not crust the steak. Rub or pat in the spice. Wrap steak tightly in plastic wrap. Place in a large container and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or, preferably, overnight.
	2. Homemade Tahini Sauce: Meanwhile, mash tahini paste and lemon juice with the back of a spoon in a bowl (the sauce will become very thick). Add 2 tbsp (30 mL) water and continue to mash the mixture, adding water, 1 tbsp (15 mL) at a time until you achieve a sauce the thickness of runny yogurt. Stir in garlic, cumin, coriander, paprika, mustard, salt and pepper. Taste and adjust seasonings. (Make ahead: Refrigerate until ready to use, for up to 3 days.)
	3. Unwrap steak (do not rinse). Pat dry with paper towel. Heat a large cast-iron skillet or other ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add oil and swirl to coat. Add steak; cook for 3 to 5 minutes per side, until brown on both sides. 
	 4. Insert oven-safe meat thermometer sideways into the centre of the steak, avoiding fat or bone. If bone extends beyond edge of pan, place skillet on a rimmed baking sheet to catch any drips. Cook in preheated 275°F oven for about 40 minutes for medium-rare, removing from oven when 5°F (3°C) below desired finished temperature (145°F/63°C for medium-rare, or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done).
	 5. Transfer steak to cutting board, cover loosely with foil and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Carve meat from the bone, then across the grain into thin slices. Arrange steak on a large platter with the bone.
	 6. Serve slices of steak with a small salad of a handful of greens, red or yellow peppers, red onion, radish and cucumber; drizzle all over with Homemade Tahini Sauce. Sprinkle with seeds and/or nuts and cilantro. Serve immediately.
Recipe Tips:
  - If you don’t have an ovenproof skillet wide enough to fit the steak, sear it in your largest skillet, positioning steak as necessary, to brown all over. Transfer steak to a wire rack on top of a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and cook as directed in the oven.

Recipe Title: Braised Beef Tongue with Vegetable Ragu
Recipe Summary: After church, we would visit the local butcher shop where my dad went to buy meat. Often the butcher would give us offcuts for free, cuts like beef tongue that were less popular. As kids, we didn’t really know what beef tongue was as my mom presented it as a ‘roast’ and we kids loved it! Although not necessarily standard fare these days, beef tongue is now a big staple when I participate in events. I seem to be the only one who serves it and it actually makes me happy even if only a few visitors come to my booth. It feels like a well-kept culinary secret.

Recipe Tips:
  - Seasoning steaks just before grilling enhances the flavour much better than if you season after grilling. You can always sprinkle with a little more seasoning just before serving. Flaked sea salt makes a nice finish that adds a wonderful pop of flavour and texture.

Recipe Title: Pan-Seared Beef Medallions with Masala Cream
Recipe Summary: Garam masala is the Indian equivalent to chili powder in Tex Mex cooking. You can make your own from a blend of spices but now that garam masala readily available in the spice section of major grocery stores, exotic dishes like this one don’t have to be complicated. This recipe uses full steaks, but you could also cut the steak into stir-fry strips to provide more servings and reduce the cooking time. This recipe was adapted from Chef Joshna Maharaj’s original and modified, as necessary, for home cooks.

Recipe Title: Oven-Roasted Steak with Garlic-Rosemary Rub
Recipe Summary: Just a few fresh ingredients are all this impressive steak cut needs to create a stunning dish. Similar to a Tomahawk-style Steak, on a Frenched Rib Steak the exposed 4-inch-long bone is cleaned of any meat and fat for a tidy presentation. This thick steak gets treated like a small roast by using our tried-and-true method of oven searing and then finishing low and slow for tender, perfectly cooked steak. Resting the steak before slicing allows it to come to the final desired temperature and for the juices to settle after cooking. Serve with classic steakhouse sides, such as Caesar salad, oven fries and roasted mushrooms or tomatoes.

	- 1 tsp (5 mL) EACH salt and fresh ground pepper
	- 3 tbsp (45 mL) butter, softened
	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) Dijon mustard
	- 4 tsp (20 mL) finely chopped fresh rosemary
	- 4 cloves garlic, minced
	- Flaked sea salt, such as Maldon
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1  Beef Frenched Rib Steak, 1-bone thick (about 3 lb/1.5 kg)
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper
	- Butter
	- Dijon mustard
	- Fresh rosemary
	- 4 cloves garlic
	- Flaked sea salt, such as Maldon
Recipe Methods:
	1. Pat steak dry with paper towel. Season all over with salt and pepper. Combine butter, mustard, rosemary and garlic in a small bowl. Rub butter mixture all over steak. 
	 2. Place steak on a wire rack on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Insert an oven-safe meat thermometer sideways into centre steak, avoiding fat and bone. Oven-sear in preheated 450°F oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 275°F; roast, uncovered, for about 50 to 60 minutes for medium-rare, removing from oven when 5°F (3°C) below desired finished temperature (145°F/63°C for medium-rare, or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done). 
	3. Transfer steak to a cutting board, cover with foil and let rest for 15 minutes.
	4. Carve meat from the bone, then into thin slices. Arrange steak on a large platter with the bone. Sprinkle with coarse salt before serving.
Recipe Tips:
  - Top steak with crumbled blue cheese or goat cheese before serving for a decadent finish. Add the leftover bone to enrich and flavour stocks, soups and stews. A Frenched Rib Steak is similar to a Tomahawk-style Steak in that it is cut 1-bone thick with an exposed bone. The Tomahawk will have a pronounced, long bone.

	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) whole black peppercorns
	- 4 tsp (20 mL) coriander seeds
	- 4 tsp (20 mL) yellow mustard seeds
	- ½ tsp (2.5 mL) whole cloves
	- 6 bay leaves
	- 1 cup (250 mL) thinly sliced celery
	- 8 cloves garlic, minced
	- ½ cup (125 mL) granulated sugar
	- 5 tbsp (75 mL) salt
	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) sweet paprika
	- 1½ tsp (7 mL) hot pepper flakes
	- ½ tsp (2 mL) ground cinnamon
	- 3 tbsp (45 mL) Worcestershire sauce
	- 1½ tsp (7 mL) liquid smoke
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1 large  Beef Tongue   (3 to 4 lb/1.5 to 2 kg)  
	- Whole black peppercorns
	- Coriander seeds
	- Yellow mustard seeds
	- Whole cloves
	- 6 bay leaves
	- Celery
	- 8 cloves garlic
	- Granulated sugar
	- Salt
	- Sweet paprika
	- Hot pepper flakes
	- Ground cinnamon
	- Worcestershire sauce
	- Liquid smoke
Recipe Methods:
	1. Trim any excess fat from the tongue using a sharp knife. Cut the tongue in half lengthwise on the underside, cutting to, but not through the skin on the other side. Open the tongue up like a book.
	2. One spice at a time, coarsely grind peppercorns, coriander seeds, mustard seeds, cloves and bay leaves using a mortar and pestle or spice grinder. Transfer to a food processor; add celery, garlic, sugar, salt, paprika, hot pepper flakes, cinnamon, Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke. Process until a thin paste is formed. 
	3. Place the paste in a large resealable freezer bag or resealable silicone food bag or vacuum seal bag large enough to hold the tongue. Add tongue to bag; massaging the bag to distribute the marinade. Remove as much air as possible and seal the bag or using vacuum sealer. Refrigerate tongue for 72 hours. 
	4. Set up water bath for sous vide and preheat to 170ºF (76.7ºC) according to manufacturer’s directions.
	5. Remove tongue from bag and rinse off marinade under cold water; discard excess marinade (the tongue will be dark in colour). Place in a new vacuum seal bag; remove as much air as possible and seal bag using vacuum sealer. Immerse bag in preheated water bath and secure it to the side of the pot with a clip, keeping the top of the bag above the surface of the water. Cover water bath with foil or plastic to reduce evaporation. Cook sous vide for 36 hours, replenishing with hot water as needed. 
	6. Remove bag from water bath and place in a sink filled with cold water; let stand until tongue is cool enough to handle, replenishing cold water, as necessary. Remove tongue from the bag and discard liquid. Peel off the skin. Start at the back end and use a small knife to lift up the skin; then, using your fingers, peel off the skin like removing a mitten, being careful to not rip the meat at the tip. Discard the skin, trim off any fat, gristle or bumps at the back of the tongue.
	  7. Serve warm or wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days (or freeze for up to 3 months).
Recipe Tips:
  - You can cook this on top of the stove instead of sous-vide. In step 5 after rinsing, place the tongue in a large pot and adding water to come up 4 inches (10 cm) over the tongue. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 3½ to 4 hours until the tongue is tender. Drain.

		- 1 tsp (5 mL) EACH dried oregano leaves and hot pepper flakes
		- ½ cup (125 mL) EACH extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar (approx)
		- 2 tsp (10 mL) hot pepper honey
		- Salt and fresh ground pepper
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1 bunch fresh Italian parsley 
	- 1 bunch fresh cilantro 
	- Garlic
	- 3 lb (1.5 kg) Beef Top Sirloin Cap Oven Roast
	- Extra virgin olive oil
	- Red wine vinegar
	- Hot pepper honey
	- Salt
	- Pepper
	- Sweet smoked paprika
	- Granulated garlic
	- Dried oregano leaves
	- Hot pepper flakes
	- Natural lump charcoal
Recipe Methods:
	1. Roast: Load fire bowl of kamado-style grill with&nbsp;natural lump charcoal in an even 2-inch (5 cm) thick layer. Light the charcoal with a paper towel in the coals or charcoal-safe fire starter and place the diffuser plate in the fire bowl. Fill a foil drip pan part way with water and place on the plate (see Tip). Place the grill grate over the diffuser plate. Close lid and preheat to medium-high (400°F/200°C), adjusting the top and bottom vent to achieve this constant temperature.
	2. Combine salt, pepper, paprika and garlic in a small bowl. Pat roast dry with paper towel. Rub roast all over with oil, then with spice mixture, rubbing to coat. Place the roast on preheated grill fat side up, insert an oven-safe programmable thermometer sideways into steak and close the lid. Cook for about 1 hour or until thermometer registers 130°F (57°C). 
	3. Hot Honey Herb Sauce: Meanwhile, finely chop parsley and cilantro and transfer to a bowl. Stir in garlic, oregano and hot pepper flakes. Stir in oil, vinegar and honey, adding more oil and vinegar as necessary until desired consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until serving.
	4. Transfer partially-cooked roast to a clean plate and set aside. Remove the diffuser plate and drip pan; lower the grill grate closer to the charcoal for high-temperature, direct-heat grilling. Brush the grate clean and close the lid. Adjust vents as necessary to heat to a temperature of about 600°F (315°C); this should take about 2 to 5 minutes. 
	5. Return roast to grill, and sear over high heat with grill lid open for 1 to 2 minutes per side until grill-marked or until thermometer reads 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare at the least (or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done). Transfer to a cutting board, cover with foil and let rest for 15 minutes.
	6. Carve roast across the grain into slices and serve with Hot Honey Herb Sauce.
	Gas Grilling Method: You can use the reverse-sear method in a three-burner gas grill. Turn on the two end burners, leaving the centre burner off; place drip tray over unlit burner. This is your indirect heat zone, where you’ll put your roast. Turn the end burners to medium-high heat and preheat grill to 400°F (200°C). Cook roast in closed barbecue over unlit burner for about 1 hour or until thermometer registers 130°F (57°C). Remove the roast and drip pan from the grill. Turn all burners to High and preheat for about 10 minutes, until the grill is 600°F (315°C). Return roast to grill and sear over high heat for 1 to 2 minutes per side or until thermometer registers 145°F (63° C) for medium-rare (or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done).
Recipe Tips:
  - If you have a half-moon plate/griddle diffuser accessory for your barbecue, cook roast over the diffuser for the indirect heat grilling, and then transfer roast to side directly over the coals to sear and complete the cooking. If you don’t have any type of diffuser, push the charcoal to one side and place the drip pan under the grill on the other side for indirect-heat cooking. When ready to sear, move the roast over to the live coal side of the grill.

	- 1 tsp (5 mL) EACH salt and fresh ground pepper
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) EACH garlic powder and onion powder
	- ¼ tsp (1 mL) ground allspice 
	- 1 rack Beef Grilling Back Ribs (about 5 lb/2.2 kg)
	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) cornstarch
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) red wine vinegar 
Recipe Shopping List:
	- Red pepper jelly, orange marmalade or apricot jam
	- Worcestershire sauce
	- Brown sugar
	- Grainy Dijon mustard
	- Chili powder
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper
	- Garlic powder
	- Onion powder
	- Ground allspice
	- 1 rack Beef Grilling Back Ribs (about 5 lb/2.2 kg)
	- Cornstarch
	- Red wine vinegar
Recipe Methods:
	1. Set up water bath for sous vide and preheat to 158°F (70°C) according to manufacturer’s instructions. 
	2. Combine red pepper jelly, brown sugar, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, chili powder, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and allspice in a small bowl. Brush jelly mixture all over ribs. 
	3. Place the ribs in an extra-large sous vide bag (vacuum, sealable freezer or reusable silicone). Remove as much air as possible and vacuum or manually seal. 
	4. Immerse bag in preheated water bath and secure to the side of the pot with a clip, keeping the top of the bag above the surface of the water. Weigh bag down to submerge, if necessary. Cover water bath with foil or plastic to reduce evaporation. Cook sous vide for 16 hours, replenishing water as necessary.
	5. Carefully remove bag from water bath and let rest for 5 minutes before opening and removing ribs. Pour the rib cooking liquid into a small saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Combine cornstarch with 1 tbsp (15 mL) cold water in a small bowl; gradually whisk into saucepan and simmer, whisking, for 2 to 3 minutes or until thickened and glossy. Remove pan from heat, stir in vinegar; set aside. 
	6. Grill ribs in a closed preheated barbecue over medium heat (350°F/180°C), or place on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and broil on the middle rack, for 5 to 10 minutes, turning occasionally, until ribs are browned. 
	7. Transfer to a cutting board. Cut rack into individual ribs. Serve with warm sauce.
Recipe Tips:
  - Removing the silverskin from the rack before brushing with the jelly mixture allows the flavours to penetrate the meat better, and enhances tenderness. To remove it from the rack, slide a thin knife between the meat and the membrane, pull up until there is enough to grab hold of with a paper towel. Like removing wallpaper, pull it off with even pressure to remove as one large sheet.

Recipe Title: Red Beer-braised Beef Shepherd's Pie
Recipe Summary: My grandmother and I always made a great shepherd's pie on cold winter days. Nothing is more comforting than some good mashed potatoes, accented with celeriac, with meat and good corn. I still remember the aroma of the onion cooking with the ground beef. I had a lot of trouble mashing the potatoes and I remember she added a lot of butter! This version is a tribute to the dish of my childhood. Did you know that this dish was invented in the 19th century during the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway? Back then, workers were fed corn, beef and potatoes but it’s the Asian workers who started to combine their rations and created this dish! French Canadian workers started to name it "pâté chinois” shortly after.

Recipe Summary: This classic restaurant combination of Beef Tenderloin and Béarnaise sauce sounds intimidating at first, but with a quick no-cook sour cream base and a no-fail roasting method, it will be easy to master. NOTE: ‘Time-to-cook’ figures are rough guidelines only as cook time is dependent on so many factors such as: oven and thermometer accuracy, starting temperature of roast, roast shape and cut.

		- 1 tsp (5 mL) Worcestershire sauce 
		- Salt
Recipe Shopping List: ???
Recipe Methods:
	1. Combine mushroom slices, oil, vinegar and oregano in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste, stir gently to coat. Set aside.
	2. Place one steak between two sheets of parchment paper. Pound with the flat side of a meat mallet or rolling pin until about ¼ inch (5 mm) thick; repeat with remaining steaks. Season steaks all over with salt and pepper to your taste.
	3. Place one sun-dried tomato, one or two basil leaves (depending on how large they are), and a slice or two of the marinated mushroom on one narrow end of a steak. Tightly roll the steak around the filling. Insert a metal skewer at each end of the roll to secure. Repeat with remaining steaks and filling. Season the outside of the involtini with salt and pepper to your taste.
	4. Grill involtini in a closed preheated barbecue over high heat (500°F/250°C) for 6 to 8 minutes, turning twice or more, or until a digital instant-read thermometer inserting sideways into each roll reads 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare doneness at the least. Transfer to cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes.
	5. Red Wine Peppercorn Sauce: Meanwhile, heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add butter and swirl to melt. Cook onions, stirring, for 1 minute. Add garlic to taste; cook, stirring, for 1 minute, until fragrant. Sprinkle in flour and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Gradually pour in wine, stirring continuously. Stir in broth, bay leaf, pepper and Worcestershire sauce; season with salt to taste. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, until thickened. Remove from heat.&nbsp;
	6. Remove skewers and slice the involtini crosswise. Spoon the sauce onto plates and arrange involtini on top. Garnish with Parmesan cheese and fresh basil.&nbsp;
Recipe Tips:
  - To cook on a charcoal barbecue: Set up your grill for direct heat cooking. Place lit charcoal directly in the centre of the grill, where you plan on cooking the steaks. If you’re looking for a smokier flavour, add a couple chunks of wood to the lit coals before adding the grill grate. Sugar maple or pecan wood would be a nice flavour pairing with this recipe. Close the lid and allow the grill to preheat to (500°F/250°C) for 10 to 12 minutes. Grill involtini on the grill grate directly over top of the coals for 6 to 8 minutes, turning twice or more, or until a digital instant-read thermometer inserting sideways into each roll reads 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare doneness at the least. Transfer to cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing to serve.

Recipe Methods:
	1. Creamy Sesame Dressing: Whisk sesame seeds, mayonnaise, honey, soy sauce, sesame oil and vinegar to taste. Set aside.
	2. Gyozas: Combine ground beef, shredded cabbage, carrots, gingerroot, cornstarch, bouillon, MSG, XO sauce, sesame oil and vegetable oil. Season with salt and pepper to your taste. Mix well. Drizzle in ¼ cup (60 mL) water and mix to combine. This will make your beef more tender. Set aside.
	3. Place a gyoza wrapper in your hand or a clean surface. Spoon a small amount of the dumpling mix (about ½ oz/16 g) onto the center of the gyoza wrapper. Moisten the edges of the wrapper with water. Fold the wrapper in half to form a half-moon shape and seal. Set the gyoza on a flat surface or in your hand. Dab a little bit of water, twist, and pinch in the middle. Alternatively, you can design it however you would like! Repeat to make 12 dumplings. Set aside.
	4. To Fry the Gyozas: Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tbsp (15 mL) of the oil and swirl to coat. Immediately add the dumplings with the bottoms down to the oil. Drizzle the cornstarch slurry evenly into the pan. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook for 5 minutes or until gyoza skins are translucent. There should be still some water or liquid left in the bottom of the pan.
	5. Remove the lid and increase heat to a medium-high. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes until bottoms are crispy and can be easily lifted from pan and liquid is evaporated. Transfer to a plate and keep warm.
	6. Snow Pea Leaves: Heat another nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until slightly smoky. Add vegetable oil. Add garlic and stir-fry for a few seconds. Add snow pea leaves, bouillon and 3 tbsp (45 mL) water. Cover and cook for 30 seconds. Remove the lid and stir in the cornstarch mixture. Cook, stirring, for about 1 minute or until leaves are glossy.
	7. To serve: Place Snow Pea Leaves on serving plates; top with Gyozas arranging with crispy bottoms up. Garnish with microgreens, crispy garlic, green onions and nori flakes. Drizzle the Creamy Sesame Dressing over top or serve in separate bowls as a dip.
Recipe Tips:
  - It is very important to use a good nonstick pan to fry the gyoza in order to get a crispy bottom without them sticking and tearing in the pan.

Recipe Title: Beef and Yellow Split Pea Stew (Khoresh Gheymeh)
Recipe Summary: Stews play a huge part in Iranian cuisine. Even though there are many different Iranian stews, a few of them are more popular among Iranians and they are pretty well-known around the world. Khoresh Gheymeh definitely stands on top three of the popular Iranian stews. In Farsi, Khoresh means stew. Gheymeh consists of beef, yellow split peas, Persian dried lime, onion and tomato paste. It’s one of the most popular dishes in every household and it takes around 3 to 4 hours to cook. In our family Gheymeh was more of a weekend lunch dish. My mom used to start making it around 8 or 9 o’clock in the morning and I would wake up to a great smell of rich tomato sauce and Limoo Amani. Limo Amani or Persian dried lime is a specific lime that has been dehydrated, usually after having spent a majority of its drying time in the sun. It’s very aromatic and tastes sour and citrusy with an earthy, somewhat smoky, taste and is a staple to Iranian cuisine. Gheymeh is always served with saffron rice. The most common sides that can be served with any stews are Shirazi salad and Torshi (pickled vegetables).

Recipe Ingredients List:
	- 4 tsp (20 mL) canola or sunflower oil, divided
	- 1 cup (250 mL) yellow split peas
	- 1 large onion, finely diced
	- 1 lb (500 g) Beef Stew Cubes
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) EACH ground turmeric and fresh ground pepper
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) tomato paste
	- Boiling water
	- 1 cinnamon stick
	- ½ tsp (2 mL) saffron threads
	- Ice cubes
	- 5 Persian dried limes
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) salt
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1 large onion
	- 1 lb (500 g) Beef Stew Cubes
	- Sunflower or canola oil
	- Ground turmeric
	- Pepper
	- Tomato paste
	- Cinnamon stick
	- Saffron threads
	- Salt
	- Yellow split peas
	- 5 Persian dried limes
Recipe Methods:
	1. Heat 1 tsp (5 mL) oil over medium-high heat in a Dutch oven or enameled cast-iron roaster. Add split peas and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes (this helps them hold their shape in the stew). Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
	2. Add remaining oil to the pot. Cook onion, stirring, for about 5 minutes until soft and golden brown. Add beef and cook, stirring, until beef is browned all over. Add turmeric, pepper and tomato paste; cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.
	3. Pour in enough boiling water to cover the meat, then add the cinnamon stick. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1½ hours.
	4. Meanwhile, grind the saffron using a mortar and pestle, then add 2 ice cubes. Set it aside and let ice melt for saffron to bloom slowly. Poke holes in dried limes with a fork.
	5. Stir saffron water, dried limes, split peas and salt into the stew. Add more boiling water, if necessary, to cover beef. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally for 1½ to 2 hours or until meat is
	fork-tender and split peas are softened.
Recipe Tips:
  - Letting the saffron bloom in melting ice prevents the saffron flavor from being shocked and allows time to release all of the flavor and color. If you’re short on time, you can add 2 tbsp (30 mL) boiling water to the ground saffron instead.

Recipe Title: Next Day Roast Beef Salad
Recipe Summary: Sometimes the best thing about roast beef is the meal that you can make the day after!

See ‘Tip’ below for how to cook a 3 lb (1.5 kg) Beef Strip Loin Oven Roast. NOTE: ‘Time-to-cook’ figures are rough guidelines only as cook time is dependent on so many factors such as: oven and thermometer accuracy, starting temperature of roast, roast shape and cut.

	- Chopped peanuts (optional)
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 2 lb (1 kg)  Beef Honeycomb Tripe 
	- 2 lb (1 kg)  Beef Oxtail , cut into 1½-inch (4 cm) pieces
	- Salt
	- Onions (about 2)
	- 8 cloves garlic

	- Fish sauce
	- 1 large Chinese eggplant
	- Long beans or green beans
	- Chinese greens such as bok choy, choi sum or gai lan
	- Hot cooked rice
	- Chopped peanuts (optional)
Recipe Methods:
	1. Place the tripe and oxtails into a large pot. Add enough cold water to cover and add 1 tbsp (15 mL) salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 10 minutes. Drain into a colander in the sink. Rinse the tripe and oxtails under cold water, removing any scum. 
	2. Cut the tripe into pieces 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide and 2 inches (5 cm) long. Return to the pot with the oxtail. Add 4 quarts (4 L) fresh water, onion, garlic and 1 tsp (5 mL) salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, reduce heat and simmer for 2½ hours, and adding more water as necessary to make sure water covers ingredients, until the meat is almost tender and the liquid is reduced to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the meat.
	3. Meanwhile, heat a small heavy skillet over low heat. Add glutinous rice flour and toast, stirring constantly, for about 5 minutes or until a shade beyond golden brown. Transfer to a bowl and let cool.
	 4. Place the annatto seeds in a small heatproof bowl. Pour in boiling water and set aside. 
	5. Bring another large pot of water to a boil over high heat. One vegetable at a time, cook the green beans, Chinese greens, then the eggplant in the boiling water for about 2 minutes per batch, until barely tender, removing them with a skimmer and rinsing under cold water to cool. Drain well and reserve. 
	 6. When the meat is almost tender, place the peanut butter in a blender and add 3 cups (750 mL) of the cooking liquid. Blend until smooth using safety precautions for blending hot liquids. Add the toasted rice powder and blend again. Stir the mixture into the pot. 
	7. Without cleaning the blender, add the annatto seeds and their soaking liquid to the blender. Blend until the seeds are broken down into small granules. Drain through a sieve directly into the pot; discard solids. 
	8. Simmer, uncovered and stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes or until stew is lightly thickened and meat is tender. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and fish sauce. Add the vegetables and heat through. Serve immediately over rice; garnish with peanuts, if desired.
Recipe Tips:
  - Tripe should be rinsed or blanched before proceeding to cook. Shallow slashes on the smoother side of the tripe will help reduce curling during cooking.

Recipe Title: Easy Oven Roast Beef with Root Vegetables and Gravy
Recipe Summary: Roast beef was traditionally served as Sunday night dinner in many households. Top Sirloin tends to be more moderately priced than Prime Rib and is lean, yet flavourful, with enough marbling for juicy tender roast beef. Use a meat thermometer to cook your roast to the doneness that you like the best – without overcooking it! NOTE: ‘Time-to-cook’ figures are rough guidelines only as cook time is dependent on so many factors such as oven and thermometer accuracy, starting temperature of roast, roast shape and cut. A good thermometer is one of your best kitchen investments.

Recipe Tips:
  - Ensure beef cubes are all of similar size to ensure the cubes cook at the same rate.

	- 1 lb (500 g) shredded mozzarella 
	- 1 tub (500 g) ricotta, drained
	- 1 cup (250 mL) grated Parmesan cheese

	- 1 tub (500 g) ricotta, drained
	- 1 cup (250 mL) grated Parmesan cheese
Recipe Methods:
	1. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large deep nonstick skillet. Cook beef, onion, garlic, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper, stirring often and using back of spoon to break up meat into small chunks, for 8 to 10 minutes or until beef is browned. Stir in passata, diced tomatoes and broth; bring to a boil. 
	2. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 to 20 minutes until sauce has thickened. Stir in basil and vinegar; remove from heat. 
	3. The lasagna will have four layers of noodles: spread 1 cup (250 mL) sauce over the bottom of a 13 x 9-inch (3 L) baking dish. Top with 2 lasagna sheets, 1/4 of the remaining sauce, 1 cup (250 mL) mozzarella, 1/3 of the ricotta and ¼ cup (60 mL) Parmesan. Repeat layers twice. Top with remaining noodles, sauce, mozzarella and Parmesan. Cover with foil. 
	 4. Bake in preheated 375°F oven for 45 minutes. Remove foil cover and bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown and bubbly. Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting to serve.
	Make ahead: Assemble lasagna in a foil pan, cover and freeze for up to 3 months. Bake from frozen in preheated 350°F oven for 2 hours. Remove foil cover and bake for 20 to 30 minutes or until golden brown and bubbly. Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting to serve. Look for fresh lasagna noodles in the refrigerated section of the deli or the dairy section near the brick cheeses.  Substitute fresh noodles with 11 oven-ready dry lasagna noodles and make 3 layers of noodles, instead of 4 layers. The lasagna will be slightly saucier than the original version, which is great for reheating leftovers.

Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1½ lb (750 g) Beef Rib Finger Meat
	- Vegetable oil
	- 4 cloves garlic
	- Gingerroot
	- 6 green onions
	- Soy sauce
	- Brown sugar
	- Sesame oil
	- Asian chili sauce, such as sambal oelek or sriracha
	- Cornstarch
	- Hot cooked rice
Recipe Methods:
	1. Trim excess fat from the meat to your taste. Starting at the thicker end of each piece of meat, make a cut in between the meat and the fibrous silverskin, lifting the fat and silverskin away from the meat while you trim along the strip of meat. (Tip: Grip the silverskin with a paper towel to prevent slipping.). Discard the trim. Cut meat crosswise into 1½-inch (4 cm) pieces.
	 2. Preheat electric pressure cooker on the sear/sauté function. 
	3. Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil in pressure cooker pot. Brown beef in batches, turning and adding remaining oil as needed, until browned on all sides. Transfer to a plate. 
	 4. Add garlic, gingerroot and half the green onions to pot. Cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes or until starting to soften. Return beef to the pot with any accumulated juices. Stir in ½ cup (125 mL) water, soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil and chili sauce. 
	5. Seal the pressure cooker lid and make sure the vent is closed. Set the pressure to HIGH and set time for 20 minutes. When the timer beeps, let pressure release naturally for 10 minutes. Quick release any remaining pressure.
	6. Skim fat from surface of sauce; discard. Combine cornstarch with 4 tsp (20 mL) cold water in a small bowl. Set pressure cooker on the sear/sauté function; bring sauce to a boil. Slowly whisk in cornstarch mixture; return to a boil. Cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes or until sauce is thickened and glossy. 
	 7. Serve over cooked rice and garnish with remaining green onions.
Recipe Tips:
  - The fibrous silverskin on finger meat is tough. Removing it before cooking makes the meat much more tender.

Recipe Title: Oven Roast Beef with Berry Wine Sauce
Recipe Summary: Cranberries and red wine give the sauce a pretty, rosy hue that's the perfect pairing with medium-rare roast beef. The shape of the roast has as much to do with the cook time as the size and the cut. NOTE: ‘Time-to-cook’ figures are rough guidelines only as cook time is dependent on so many factors such as: oven and thermometer accuracy, starting temperature of roast, roast shape and cut. A good thermometer is one of your best kitchen investments.

	- Cherry tomatoes on the vine
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper
	- 1 demi-baguette 
	- Fresh chives
	- Fresh lemon juice
Recipe Methods:
	1. Pat steaks dry with paper towel. Season all over with steak spice. 
	2. Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil over medium-high heat in large cast-iron or oven-safe shallow heavy skillet. Add steaks and asparagus; cook for 4 to 6 minutes, turning steak once and tossing asparagus occasionally. (Note: If asparagus is very thin, add to pan with cherry tomatoes in step 3 instead).
	 3. Brush cherry tomatoes with remaining oil; add to pan and season with salt and pepper. Transfer pan to preheated 400°F oven and cook steak for 5 to 7 minutes for medium-rare doneness (145°F/63°C) at the least, testing doneness with a digital instant-read thermometer inserted sideways into steak (or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done). The asparagus should be tender-crisp and tomatoes starting to blister. (If steak is done before vegetables, transfer to plate and keep warm.) 
	 4. Let steaks rest for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, place baguette in hot oven and bake for 4 to 5 minutes or until warmed. 
	 5. Sprinkle steak and vegetables with chives and lemon juice. Serve with warm baguette. 
Recipe Tips:
  - If asparagus is very thin, add to pan with cherry tomatoes in step 3. Serve with a dollop of basil pesto or olive tapenade for the vegetables or baguette. Add crumbled feta or goat cheese to vegetables as soon as they come from oven, if desired.

Recipe Shopping List:
	- 3 lb (1.5 kg) Beef Brisket, Flat Portion (Pot Roast)
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper
	- Vegetable oil
	- Sliced mushrooms
	- 1 onion
	- 2 cloves garlic
	- Fresh rosemary
	- Tomato paste

	- 2 bay leaves
	- 1 lb (500 g) dry broad egg noodles, pappardelle or tagliatelle 
	- Fresh parsley
	- Parmesan cheese
Recipe Methods:
	1. Pat beef dry with paper towel. Season all over with 1 tsp (5 mL) each salt and pepper. Heat half the oil over medium-high heat in a large Dutch oven or enamelled cast-iron roaster; brown beef, turning until browned all over. Transfer to a plate. 
	 2. Add remaining oil to pot. Add sliced mushrooms, onion, garlic, rosemary and remaining salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, for 5 to 8 minutes or until starting to soften and brown. Stir in tomato paste; cook, stirring, for 2 minutes or until deep red. Pour in wine and simmer, stirring and scraping up browned bits from bottom of pot, for 3 to 5 minutes or until reduced by half. Stir in diced tomatoes, broth, dried mushrooms and bay leaves; bring to a boil. 
	3. Return beef and any accumulated juices to pot; nestle beef in sauce to ensure it is covered in liquid. Cover and cook in preheated 325°F oven for about 3 to 3½ hours or until meat is fork-tender.
	 4. Transfer roast to a cutting board, cover with foil and let rest for 15 minutes. Skim fat from sauce and remove bay leaves; discard.
	 5. Meanwhile, cook noodles according to package directions; drain. Toss cooked noodles with half the sauce and the parsley in a large bowl until well coated.
	 6. Carve roast across the grain into thin slices and arrange over noodles, top with remaining sauce. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
Recipe Tips:
  - A Dutch oven, enamelled cast-iron roaster or heavy, ovenproof saucepan with a tight-fitting lid are essential when braising, as they keep the moisture and heat evenly distributed, resulting in tender and juicy meat. Some chefs will not only cover with a lid, but will also cut a piece of parchment paper (called a cartouche) to fit snugly inside the pan directly over the braising mixture to further enhance the moisture of the braise.

	- 1 carrot
	- 1 white onion
	- 1 stalk celery
	- 1 leek
	- 4 cloves garlic
	- Cloves

	- 1 small baguette (a demi-baguette or half regular)
	- Olive oil
	- Salt and pepper
	- Fresh Italian parsley
	- Lemon
	- Prepared horseradish
Recipe Methods:
	1. Rinse beef bones and pat dry with paper towel. Arrange in a single layer in a roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet. Roast in preheated 400°F oven for about 30 minutes or until golden brown.
	 2. Transfer roasted bones to a large stock pot or Dutch oven, scraping in brown bits from pan. Add beef stock, carrot, onion, celery, leek, garlic, cloves and peppercorns. Add enough water to cover the bones by about 3 inches (7.5 cm). Bring to a simmer over a medium-low heat. Simmer, uncovered, for 2 hours, skimming of any scum that rises to the surface frequently.
	 3. Add Bubble Meat, bay leaves, thyme and salt to the pot. Simmer for 3 hours longer, or until a skewer easily pierces and slides in and out of the bubble meat. Remove the pot from the heat; transfer the meat to a bowl and let both cool to room temperature. Strain the stock through a colander or a large sieve into a clean pot; discarding solids. Cover and refrigerate both stock and meat separately until ready to serve (overnight) or for up to 3 days.
	 4. Horseradish Gremolata Crostini: Cut the baguette into about 12 thin slices, about ¼-inch (5 mm) thick. Place in single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Brush both sides of slices with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Bake in preheated 350°F oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until crispy and golden, turning over if not browning on the undersides. Set aside.
	5. Combine parsley, garlic, lemon zest and horseradish in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve (Make ahead: Refrigerate for up to 1 day.)
	 6. To serve: bring stock to a simmer over medium heat. Taste for seasoning and add more salt, if needed.
	7. Carve the Bubble Meat across the grain into slices no thicker than ½ inch (1 cm). Add the sliced meat to the soup to heat up, about 1 minute.
	 8. Ladle the soup into 6 warmed serving bowls and add 2 to 3 slices of meat to each bowl. Spoon Horseradish Gremolata on top of crostini; float 2 crostini in each bowl of soup or serve on the side with spoon, steak knife and fork.
Recipe Tips:
  - Centre-cut Shank can be used as an alternative to the Bubble Meat, reducing the cooking time for the meat to 2 hours in step 3.

Recipe Title: Grilled Sous Vide Flank Steak with Mushroom Lemon Tapenade
Recipe Summary: A marinating flank steak doesn’t even need to be marinated ahead when you cook sous vide; it becomes juicy and tender as it cooks in its own juices. Sous vide cooking takes the guesswork out of cooking steak to your desired doneness–the temperature you set your water bath is the internal temperature your steak will cook to, every time! Be sure to sear on a hot grill or grill pan for the final browning. The savoury tapenade with mushrooms is a twist on the French classic and tailor made to go with beef. Roast potatoes or frites and a leafy, vinaigrette-dressed salad would be ideal to complete the meal.

	- 1 clove garlic
	- Fennel seeds
	- Pinch dried thyme leaves
	- Pitted green olives
	- Lemon
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper
	- Fresh parsley
Recipe Methods:
	1. Steak: Set up water bath for sous vide and preheat to 130°F (54.5°C) for medium-rare or 140°F (60°C) for medium according to manufacturer’s directions.
	2. Combine fennel seeds and ¼ tsp (1 mL) salt in a small bowl. Pat steak dry with paper towel and pierce all over with a fork. Rub fennel mixture all over steak. Place in a large bag for sous vide (vacuum, sealable freezer or reusable silicone). Pour in lemon juice, massaging to evenly coat meat. Remove as much air as possible and vacuum or manually seal. 
	 3. Immerse bag in preheated water bath and secure it to the side of the pot with a clip, keeping the top of the bag above the surface of the water. Weigh bag down with a large spoon, if necessary to keep it immersed. Cook sous vide for 4 hours.
	4. Mushroom Lemon Tapenade : Meanwhile, heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Cook mushrooms, garlic, fennel seeds and thyme, stirring, for about 10 minutes or until mushrooms release their liquid and start to brown. Let cool slightly.
	5. Combine mushroom mixture, olives, lemon zest and juice in a small food processor until fine or mash in a mortar with pestle. Add just enough of the remaining oil until tapenade is the desired texture. Transfer to a bowl, stir in parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour for flavours to blend or for up to 3 days. Let warm to room temperature before serving.
	 6. To serve, preheat barbecue to medium-high (400°F/200°C) or heat a large grill pan over medium-high heat until very hot.
	7. Remove the beef from the water bath. Remove steak from bag, discarding liquid from bag, and transfer to a plate. Pat steak dry with paper towel; season all over with salt and pepper. Lightly oil pan, if using. Grill steak for 2 to 4 minutes, turning once, or until sizzling and well-browned on both sides. Transfer to a cutting board.
	8. Cut steak across the grain on a diagonal into thin slices and serve on warmed plates with Mushroom Lemon Tapenade.
Recipe Tips:
  - For convenience, you can cook the steak in step 3 for up to 6 hours. To make ahead, immerse bag in a sink or bowl of ice water and chill, replenishing ice as necessary until cold. Refrigerate in bag for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 6 months. Thaw in refrigerator overnight. Reheat in a 130°F (54.5°C) or 140°F (60°C) water bath for 30 minutes, then proceed with grilling.

Recipe Title: Oven Roast Beef with Simple Wine Sauce
Recipe Summary: For busy parents, roast beef has to be the easiest meal to make. Just rub it all over with salt and pepper, pop it in the oven and the job is done! Let it rest while you make a simple pan sauce. Our time-test results are based on a roast that was about 6¼-in (15 cm) long x 5¼-in (13 cm wide) x 4¾-in (12 cm) deep. NOTE: ‘Time-to-cook’ figures are rough guidelines only as cook time is dependent on so many factors such as oven and thermometer accuracy, starting temperature of roast, roast shape and cut. A good thermometer is one of your best kitchen investments.

	- 2 tsp (10 mL) finely chopped fresh rosemary
	- ¾ cup (175 mL) reduced-sodium beef broth 
	- ⅓ cup (75 mL) dry red wine
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) whole berry cranberry sauce or red pepper jelly
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) cold butter, cut into cubes
	- Chopped fresh parsley 
Recipe Shopping List:
	- Garlic
	- Fresh rosemary
	- Fresh parsley
	- ½ lb (250 g) Beef Eye of Round Fast-fry Steaks (about 2 steaks)
	- Vegetable oil
	- Reduced-sodium beef broth 
	- Salt
	- Pepper
	- Whole berry cranberry sauce or red pepper jelly
	- Butter
	- ⅓ cup (75 mL) dry red wine
Recipe Methods:
	1. Pat steaks dry with paper towel; season all over with salt and pepper.
	2. Heat oil over medium-high heat in nonstick skillet; cook steaks, for 4 to 6 minutes, turning once or more until steaks are cooked to medium (160ºF/71ºF) and browned but still pink inside. Transfer to a plate, cover loosely with foil to keep warm; set aside.
	3. Reduce heat to medium. Add garlic and rosemary to skillet; cook, stirring, for 30 to 60 seconds or until fragrant. Pour in beef broth and red wine; bring to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3 to 5 minutes or until reduced by half. Stir in cranberry sauce. Reduce heat to low.&nbsp;
	4. Add butter, one cube at a time, stirring or swirling skillet to allow each piece to dissolve before adding the next. Move skillet back and forth from heat, for about 2 to 3 minutes or as needed, to dissolve butter to a creamy consistency.&nbsp;
	5. Serve sauce over steaks. Sprinkle with parsley.&nbsp;
Recipe Tips:
  - The secret to this luscious sauce is the cold butter. Using cold butter to finish a pan sauce adds body and sheen, and is a classic French technique called mounting. There are a few key elements needed for success; the butter must be cold and the heat cannot be too high or the sauce will separate. Be sure that each piece of butter is fully incorporated before adding the next piece. If the sauce is getting too hot, just remove from the heat for a few seconds before adding the next butter cube.

	- Garlic
	- Baby spinach
	- Salt and pepper
Recipe Methods:
	1. Puff Pastry Wellies: Roll out the puff pastry dough on lightly floured board to a thickness of ½-inch (1 cm). Using a sharp knife or cookie cutter, cut pastry into 3-inch (7.5 cm) circles. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them apart. Pierce each pastry piece several times with a fork. Whisk egg with 1 tbsp (15 mL) water in a small bowl and brush pastry circles with egg wash. Bake in preheated oven 425ºF for 10 to 12 minutes until golden brown. Set aside.
	 2. Beef Medallions: Reduce oven heat to 375ºF. Brush both sides of beef medallions with 1 tbsp (15 mL) of the oil and season with salt and pepper to your taste. Heat remaining oil and 1 tbsp (15 mL) butter over medium-high heat in a heavy skillet; in batches as necessary, brown meat on both sides, about 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking sheet; set aside.
	 3. Melt remaining butter in same skillet. Add shallots and onion; cook, stirring, for about 1 minute or until softened. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 to 10 minutes or until liquid has evaporated and mushrooms start to brown. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

	5. Meanwhile, top each beef medallion with pâté slices and mushroom mixture. Bake in oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until digital instant-read thermometer inserted sideways into centre of medallions registers 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare (or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done) to finish. 
	6. To finish sauce, stir in a generous splash of whipping cream to taste. If desired, thicken sauce by stirring in cornstarch mixture; cook, stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes until slightly thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour onto gravy boat to serve; reserve skillet for spinach.
	7. Wilted Spinach: Return skillet to medium-high heat; add butter and garlic; cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add baby spinach and salt and pepper to your taste, stir to cover with butter for 30 seconds. Turn off heat, cover and allow spinach to wilt.
	 8. Arrange Wilted Spinach and 1 or 2 Puff Pastry Wellies on serving plates; place Beef Medallions on top of spinach and spoon Madeira Mushroom Sauce over beef.
Recipe Tips:
  - If you buy puff pastry in pre-rolled sheets, stack the 2 sheets and pinch around edges to squeeze the sheets together making sure there are no air bubble between the sheets. Roll just slightly to help sheets adhere to each other. It may be a little thinner than ½-inch (1 cm) thick but will still work. The package sizes may range between 397 g and 500 g and any of these will work for this recipe.

	- 8 oz (250 g) Beef Stir-Fry Strips
	- Wholegrain brown rice
	- 6 baby bok choy
	- Vegetable oil
	- Julienned gingerroot
	- 3 large cloves garlic
	- Hot pepper flakes (optional)
	- Carrots
	- Sliced white or crimini mushrooms
	- Chicken broth or water
	- Frozen corn kernels
	- Unsalted peanuts
	- Cilantro leaves or green onions
Recipe Methods:
	1. Whisk together soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, sesame oil and cornstarch together in small measuring cup. Pour half into a medium bowl for marinade and set remaining aside. Add stir-fry strips to marinade and toss to coat; cover and refrigerate for 15 to 30 minutes.
	 2. Meanwhile cook rice according to package directions. Separate individual bok choy leaves from stalks; set aside. Remove beef from marinade with slotted spoon, reserving marinade. Place beef on a plate. 
	 3. Heat 2 tsp (10 mL) of the vegetable oil over medium heat in large nonstick skillet or wok until hot. Add gingerroot, garlic and hot pepper flakes (if using); stir-fry for 30 seconds or until fragrant but not browned. Add beef to skillet. Cook for about 1 minute per side, or until browned. Transfer to a clean bowl; keep warm.
	 4. Add remaining vegetable oil to the skillet; stir-fry bok choy, carrots, onions and mushrooms for 3 to 5 minutes or until carrots start to soften. Add broth and corn (if using); cover and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until vegetables are just tender-crisp. Push vegetables to the sides of skillet. 
	5. Pour reserved soy sauce mixture and leftover marinade into centre of skillet; boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly until slightly thickened. Return beef mixture along with any accumulated juices to skillet and add peanuts; toss with vegetables and heat through. Serve over hot rice and garnish with cilantro.
Recipe Tips:
  - For making stir-fry at home, a large, flat-bottomed skillet works better than a wok since it’s difficult to get enough heat on a home stove for using a wok, unless you are cooking on a gas stove-top.

Recipe Title: Classic Cabbage Rolls
Recipe Summary: Although not difficult to make, cabbage rolls do take some time to prepare and assemble but are well worth the effort. Although not traditional, you can substitute basmati rice for the long-grain rice. Serve with simple boiled potatoes, steamed green beans and a dollop of sour cream for a decadent and cool finish.

Recipe Ingredients List:
	- 1 green cabbage, about 4 lb (2 kg)
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) olive oil
	- 1 onion, finely chopped
	- 2 cloves garlic, minced
	- ½ cup (125 mL) uncooked long-grain white rice
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) sweet paprika
	- 1 lb (500 g) Extra Lean Ground Beef 
	- 1 egg, beaten
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) EACH salt and fresh ground pepper
	- 4 bay leaves
	- 1 jar (680 mL) strained puréed tomatoes (passata)
	- 2 cups (500 mL) reduced-sodium beef broth (approx)
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1 green cabbage
	- Olive oil
	- 1 onion
	- 2 cloves garlic
	- Long-grain white rice
	- Sweet paprika
	- 1 lb (500 g)  Extra Lean Ground Beef 
	- 1 egg
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper
	- 4 bay leaves
	- Strained puréed tomatoes
	- Reduced-sodium beef broth
Recipe Methods:
	1. Place cabbage on a cutting board with the bottom pointing up. Firmly push a fork into the core of the cabbage and grip the fork to hold the cabbage in place. Using the tip of a thin sharp knife, insert point-down just outside the core on an angle, then cut around the core to remove (the core should be a cone shape once removed). 
	 2. Bring 3 inches (8 cm) of water to a boil in a large, deep pot over medium-high heat. Place cabbage, core-side down, in water. Cook cabbage, covered, for 3 to 5 minutes or until outer leaves are wilted and pliable. Leaving cabbage in the pot, use tongs to carefully pull outer leaves from cabbage and transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet. If leaves do not release easily, cover pot again and steam cabbage for an additional 2 to 3 minutes, continuing process until there are 18 to 20 large leaves. Drain remaining head of cabbage and set aside. Let leaves cool completely. 
	 3. Meanwhile, heat oil over medium heat in a medium nonstick skillet. Cook onions and garlic, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes or until starting to soften. Add rice and paprika; cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes or until well coated. Transfer to a large bowl; let cool completely. Gently mix in ground beef, egg, salt and pepper with a fork (careful not to over-mix).
	  4. Thinly slice remaining cabbage on the head and arrange 2 cups (500 mL) in bottom of a greased large roasting pan. Set aside remaining sliced cabbage to cover rolls once assembled. Trim hard veins from center of each large cabbage leaf; discard.
	 5. Working with one leaf at a time, place 2 tbsp (30 mL) beef filling on core end of the leaf, fold in sides over filling and roll up tightly from core-end to tip of leaf to enclose. Place rolls, seam side down, in prepared roasting pan. Top with bay leaves.
	6. Pour passata and broth over cabbage rolls to cover. Add a splash of broth or water to the passata jar, cap with lid and shake to rinse jar; pour into the pan. (If cabbage rolls are not covered, add some water or additional broth). Top with reserved sliced cabbage.
	 7. Cover and bake in preheated 350°F oven for 1½ hours or until cabbage is tender. Uncover and add up to 2 cups (500 mL) water or additional broth if cabbage rolls look dry. Bake, uncovered, for an additional 30 to 45 minutes or until sauce has thickened. Discard bay leaves. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
Recipe Tips:
  - For big and bold flavours, layer sauerkraut and a few strips of lightly cooked bacon strips over the cabbage rolls before baking. A savoy cabbage will work just as well for this recipe but the cabbage rolls may bake slightly faster due to the thinner, more tender leaves.

	2. Pat steaks dry with paper towel and season with salt and pepper to your taste. Grill in a closed barbecue over medium-high heat, turning at least twice, for about 10 to 12 minutes for 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick steaks for medium-rare 145°F (63°C) at the least. Meanwhile, if desired, grill lemon halves, cut-side down, for about 4 minutes or until browned. 
	3. Transfer steaks to cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. Brush steaks with some of the pistou. Slice across the grain and serve with grilled lemons (if using) and pistou on the side.
Recipe Tips:
  - Be sure to let steaks rest for about 5 minutes after cooking so that the juices get the chance to settle before you serve or slice.

Recipe Title: Pesto-Stuffed Rolled Oven Roast
Recipe Summary: Roast beef with an impressive presentation –a spiral stuffed roast with a flavourful pesto stuffing. When purchasing the Eye of Round roast, ask for the centre cut that is not tapered and one that is 4 inches (10 cm) or less in diameter. This will make it easier to cut into an even thickness and form a rectangle that is easy to stuff and roll. For convenience, you can ask the butcher to roll-cut (or spiral-cut) the roast for you and purchase prepared pesto.

Recipe Ingredients List:
	- 2 slices bread, crusts removed
	- ⅓ cup (75 mL) prepared basil pesto
	- 1 cup (250 mL) fresh Italian parsley leaves
	- 2 lb (1 kg)Beef Eye of Round Oven Roast, well trimmed
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper
	- Olive oil
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 2 slices bread
	- Basil pesto
	- Italian parsley leaves
	- 2 lb (1 kg)Beef Eye of Round Oven Roast, well trimmed
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper
	- Olive oil
Recipe Methods:
	1. Tear bread into chunks and place in small food processor. Add pesto and parsley; process to form paste. Set aside.
	 2. Place roast on a cutting board with one round end toward you. Starting on one side at the top, with the knife parallel to the cutting board, cut horizontally into ½-inch (1 cm) thickness, while slowly rolling the roast in the opposite direction, cutting as you “unroll” from the centre to form a flat, rectangular strip. Pound gently with a jagged side of the meat mallet to even thickness, about ¼ inch (5 mm). Season with salt and pepper to your taste. Set aside.
	3. Spread paste evenly over meat, leaving a ½-inch (1 cm) border around edge. Starting with a short side, roll up like a jelly roll. Tie tightly in 1-inch (2.5 cm) intervals with butcher’s twine to secure. Brush with olive oil; season with salt and pepper to your taste.
	 4. Place on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Insert oven-safe meat thermometer into centre of roast, making sure tip is in meat, not stuffing. Roast, uncovered, in preheated 300°F oven for about 2 hours for medium-rare, removing from oven when 5°F (3°C) below desired finished temperature (145°F/63°C for medium-rare, or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done).
	 5. Transfer to cutting board, cover with foil and let rest for 15 minutes. Cut across the grain into ¼-inch (5 mm) thick slices.
Recipe Tips:
  - To prep this roast ahead for entertaining, you can cut and pound the meat up to 1 day ahead. Roll up and wrap tightly, then refrigerate for up to 1 day. Make the pesto stuffing up to 8 hours ahead, transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate until about 30 minutes before assembling the roast. Assemble just before roasting.

	2. Drain barley mixture and transfer to a large saucepan. Add 4 cups (1 L) fresh water and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook at a constant, rolling boil for 20 to 30 minutes or until soft. Remove from heat.
	3. Purée in the saucepan using an immersion blender (or let cool slightly and transfer in batches to an upright blender), blending until fairly smooth. Set aside.
	4. Heat oil over medium heat in a large enamelled cast-iron roaster, Dutch oven or heavy stock pot. Add peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves and cardamom; cook, stirring, for 1 minute.

	Stir in garam masala, cilantro and mint to taste and a squeeze of lemon.

Recipe Tips:
  - I use a mix of red lentils, split chickpeas, split black lentils and split mung beans but you can also just use a combination of two of these. *For the garlic and gingerroot paste, you can use the purée or paste found in jars in the grocery store or use a fine grater, such as a Microplane, to make your own purée in small amounts just as you need it. **Fried onions, which are crispy, dehydrated fried onions, can be found in packages or containers at any Indian grocery store or in the Southeast Asian section of well-stocked supermarkets.

Recipe Methods:
	1. Oven-Roasted Frites: Cut potato lengthwise into ½-inch (1 cm) thick slices. Place slices cut-side down and cut into thin sticks, about ¼ inch (5 mm) thick. Toss with oil, salt and pepper in a medium bowl and arrange in single layer on parchment paper-lined rimmed baking sheet. Roast fries in preheated 425°F oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown around the edges with a tender center. Sprinkle Parmesan and thyme (if using) over fries. 
	2. Air-fryer Steak: Meanwhile, pat steak dry with paper towel; rub with oil and season all over with coarse pepper and salt. Place steak in basket of air fryer and cook at 400°F (200°C) for 8 to 10 minutes or until a digital instant-read thermometer inserted sideways into centre of steak reads 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare doneness at the least (or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done). Transfer to cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. 
	3. Garlic Aioli: Meanwhile, combine mayonnaise, olive oil, Parmesan, lemon zest, lemon juice, thyme and garlic in a small bowl.
	 4. Slice steak across the grain and serve with Oven-roasted Frites and Garlic Aioli for dipping.

	- 6 cloves garlic, minced
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) grated lemon zest
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) fresh lemon juice 
	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) fennel seeds, lightly crushed
	- 1½ tsp (7 mL) EACH salt and fresh ground pepper
	- ¼ tsp (1 mL) hot pepper flakes
	- 4 lb (2 kg) Beef Inside Round Oven Roast 
	- Butcher’s twine
Recipe Shopping List:
	- Olive oil
	- Fresh parsley
	- Sage
	- Fresh rosemary
	- 6 cloves garlic
	- Lemon
	- Fennel seeds
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper
	- Hot pepper flakes
	- 4 lb (2 kg)  Beef Inside Round Oven Roast 
	- Butcher’s twine
Recipe Methods:
	1. Combine olive oil, parsley, sage, rosemary, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, fennel seeds, salt, pepper and hot pepper flakes in a small bowl; set aside. 
	 2. Pat roast dry with paper towel. Using a carving knife, slice roast in half lengthwise, stopping when you are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from bottom of the roast. Open the roast up like a book and cut one side to ‘unroll’ the roast to be about 1-inch (2.5 cm) thick. Repeat with the other side so that you end up with a rectangular piece of meat that is about 1-inch (2.5 cm) thick. Using the textured side of a meat mallet, pound beef to even thickness, if needed. 
	3. Spread three-quarters of the herb mixture over the inside of the beef (cut side). Starting at one long side, roll roast up into a log, jelly-roll style. Tie with butcher’s string, at about 2-inch (5 cm) intervals. Brush remaining herb mixture all over outside of roast. Set aside in refrigerator while you heat up the barbecue.
	 4. Fill drip pan with water and place under grill (off to one side). Preheat barbecue to medium-high (400°F/200°C). 
	 5. Insert oven-safe meat thermometer into centre of roast. Place roast on grill over drip pan; turn off burner under drip pan. Close lid and cook for about 1¼ to 1¾ hours for medium-rare, removing from grill when 5°F (3°C) below desired finished temperature (145°F/63°C for medium-rare, or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done).
	  6. Transfer roast to a cutting board, cover with foil and let rest for 15 minutes. Cut twine and remove. Carve roast across the grain into thin slices.
Recipe Tips:
  - Letting roast rest and carving it thinly across the grain will help ensure meat is tender and juicy.

	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) EACH chili powder, fresh ground pepper and brown sugar
	- 2 tsp (10 mL) salt

	- 2 lb (1 kg) Beef Eye of Round Oven Roast
Recipe Methods:
	1. Combine oil, vinegar, espresso powder, cocoa powder, chili powder, pepper, brown sugar and salt. Stir 1 tbsp (15 mL) coffee-cocoa rub into barbecue sauce; set aside. Pat roast dry with paper towel and brush evenly with remaining coffee-cocoa rub. 
	 2. Fill drip pan with water and place under grill (off to one side). Preheat barbecue to medium-high (400°F/200°C). 
	3. Insert oven-safe meat thermometer into centre of roast. Place roast on grill over drip pan; turn off burner under drip pan. Close lid and cook for about 1¼ to 1½ hours for medium-rare, removing from grill when 5°F (3°C) below desired finished temperature (145°F/63°C for medium-rare, or 160°F/71°C for medium at the most).
	 4. Transfer roast to a cutting board, cover with foil and let rest for 15 minutes. Carve roast across the grain into thin slices and serve with reserved barbecue sauce mixture.
Recipe Tips:
  - Leftover roast beef can be diced and simmered in barbecue sauce, and then served in warm corn tortillas with guacamole, corn, jalapeño slices and crumbled feta. Eye of Round is a very lean cut, so our recommendation is to cook no more than to medium doneness and to slice thinly.

Recipe Ingredients List:
	- 1½ lb (750 g) Beef Rib Finger Meat 
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) oyster sauce
	- 1½ tsp (7 mL) fresh ground pepper 
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) granulated garlic
	- 1 to 2 tbsp (15 to 30 mL) vegetable oil
	- 2 tbsp (30 mL) unsalted butter
	- 4 large cloves garlic, minced
	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) minced fresh parsley
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1½ lb (750 g)  Beef Rib Finger Meat 
	- Oyster sauce
	- Fresh ground pepper
	- Granulated garlic
	- Vegetable oil
	- Unsalted butter
	- 4 large cloves garlic
	- Fresh parsley
Recipe Methods:
	1. Trim excess fat from the meat to your taste. Starting at the thicker end of each piece of meat, make a cut in between the meat and the fibrous silverskin, lifting the fat and silver skin away from the meat while you trim along the strip of meat. (Tip: Grip the silverskin with a paper towel to prevent slipping.) Discard the trim. Cut the meat crosswise into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces. Place in a bowl and add oyster sauce, pepper and granulated garlic, tossing to coat.
	 2. Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Cook beef, in batches, for about 2 to 3 minutes per side, letting the beef brown without moving it around to develop a good crust before turning, until well browned on both sides and a digital instant-read thermometer inserted into cubes reads 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare at the least (or 160°F/71°C for medium, or 170°F/77°C for well-done). Transfer to a plate. Add more oil to pan between batches, as necessary.
	3. Add butter to skillet and melt over medium heat. Cook garlic, stirring, for about 1 minute or until golden around the edges. Add the beef and quickly toss to coat it in the garlic butter. Toss with the parsley and serve immediately.
Recipe Tips:
  - The membrane on finger meat is tough. Removing it before cooking makes the meat significantly more tender.

Recipe Title: Horseradish-Crusted Oven Roast with Classic Pan Gravy
Recipe Summary: The horseradish and cracked pepper crust makes simple seem special with this oven roast. To crack the peppercorns, place them in a sturdy plastic freezer bag and crush with the back of a heavy skillet or hammer. Our time-test results are based on a roast that was about 7¼-in (18 cm) long x 5¼-in (13 cm wide) x 3½-in (9 cm) deep. NOTE: ‘Time-to-cook’ figures are rough guidelines only as cook time is dependent on so many factors such as oven and thermometer accuracy, starting temperature of roast, roast shape and cut. A good thermometer is one of your best kitchen investments.

Recipe Title: Barbecued Roast for Two
Recipe Summary: Put your barbecue to work to cook roast beef to perfection. Use indirect heat to cook the roast evenly without flare-ups. The shape of the roast has as much to do with the cook time as the size and the cut. NOTE: ‘Time-to-cook’ figures are rough guidelines only as cook time is dependent on so many factors such as: barbecue and thermometer accuracy, starting temperature of roast, roast shape and cut. A good thermometer is one of your best kitchen investments.

Recipe Ingredients List:
	- Burgers
		- 1 lb (500 g) Medium Ground Beef
		- Salt and pepper
		- 8 slices Cheddar cheese
		- ¼ cup (60 mL) butter, divided
		- 4 sesame seed buns, cut horizontally into thirds
		- ½ cup (125 mL) minced white onion
		- 2 cups (500 mL) shredded iceberg lettuce
		- 2 dill pickles, thinly sliced into rounds (16 to 24 slices)
	- “Mac” Sauce
		- 1 cup (250 mL) mayonnaise
		- ¼ cup (60 mL) minced dill pickle
		- 2 tbsp (30 mL) minced white onion
		- 2 tbsp (30 mL) prepared yellow mustard
		- 4 tsp (20 mL) pickle juice or white wine vinegar
		- 4 tsp (20 mL) ketchup
		- 1 tsp (5 mL) sweet paprika
		- ½ tsp (2 mL) garlic powder
		- Salt and pepper
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1 white onion
	- Iceberg lettuce
	- 4 sesame seed buns (unsliced)
	- 1 lb (500 g) Medium Ground Beef
	- Mayonnaise
	- Prepared yellow mustard
	- Ketchup
	- Dill pickles
	- Pickle juice or white wine vinegar
	- Salt
	- Pepper
	- Sweet paprika
	- Garlic powder
	- 8 slices Cheddar cheese
	- Butter
Recipe Methods:
	1. Burgers: Divide the ground beef into 8 equal portions and loosely shape into balls. Place on a tray, cover and refrigerate while preparing remaining ingredients. 
	2. “Mac” Sauce: Combine mayonnaise, minced pickle, onion, mustard, pickle juice, ketchup, paprika and garlic powder in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste and set aside.
	3. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Place 1 ball of meat in the pan, off centre, and quickly smash it firmly with a flat metal spatula or burger press until it is about ¼ inch (5 mm) thick. Repeat with 1 to 3 more balls, as the size of the skillet allows. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Cook for about 2 minutes, until the edges are browned and crispy. Flip the patties, season with salt and pepper and lay a cheese slice on each. Cook for 1 minute more, or until browned and cooked to 160°F (71°C) doneness at the least. Transfer to plate and set aside to rest. Repeat with remaining beef.
	4. Drain any excess fat from pan and discard. Return skillet to medium-high. Melt 1 tbsp (15 mL) of the butter and arrange one of the buns, cut-side down, to toast until just golden, flipping the middle slice to toast on the other side. Set aside. Repeat with remaining butter and buns.
	5. To assemble, for each burger, place bottom bun on a plate. Spread with "Mac" Sauce, sprinkle with 1 tbsp (15 mL) of onion, ¼ cup (60 mL) lettuce, 1 patty with cheese facing down, then 3 pickles. Top with middle bun and repeat topping with “Mac” Sauce, onion, lettuce, burger patty and pickles. Drizzle with remaining sauce and sandwich with the top bun and give it a squeeze.
Recipe Tips:
  - Keep the meat in the fridge until just before cooking, this ensures the fat in the meat stays solid, resulting in a juicier, more crisp patty, than using less cold meat. Use a square of parchment paper placed on top of the patties before smashing them to ensure that the meat does not stick to the spatula or burger press.

	- Garlic Bread
	- red onion
	- 1 cucumber
	- 4 to 6 fresh cilantro sprigs
	- 1 jalapeño
	- soy sauce
	- crushed peanuts
Recipe Methods:
	1. Satay Beef: Combine sliced beef, shallot, garlic, soy sauce, fish sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, and pepper in a large bowl. Mix well, making sure beef is evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or for up to 12 hours
	  2. Pickled Carrots and Radish: Combine carrots, daikon, vinegar, ¼ cup (60 mL) water, sugar and salt in a 2 cup (500 mL) mason jar. Seal jar with lid and shake gently to mix thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate for up to 12 hours, until ready to assemble the sandwich. 
	 3. Remove beef from marinade; discard marinade. Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil over medium-high heat in a cast-iron skillet. Cook beef, in 2 batches, for 5 to 7 minutes, turning frequently with tongs, until the beef is cooked through and is slightly charred. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Add more oil to the skillet between batches, if necessary.
	4. Sandwiches: Bake Furlani Garlic Bread according to package instructions. 
	5. Place garlic bread loaf halves with the cut side up on a cutting board lined with a sheet of parchment. Run the backside of a serving spoon along the cut side of each loaf half, to make an indentation to hold the filling. Arrange Satay Beef on bottom half of the loaf, filling the indentation that was made. Top beef with cucumber, onion and jalapeño. Top the second half of the loaf with drained Pickled Carrots and Daikon, filling the indentation. (Serve any extra Pickled Carrots and Radish as a side dish to go along with the sandwich.) Top with cilantro, soy sauce and crushed peanuts, if using. Put the sandwich top and bottom together, rolling up in the parchment paper. Cut through the parchment paper, cutting the sandwich diagonally in half.
Recipe Tips:
  - *Hot pot-style beef is thinly sliced rib eye or top sirloin, typically sold in Asian or Quebec grocery stores in the freezer section or fresh meat counter. If you’re unable to find pre-sliced beef, partially freeze a beef steak and carefully carve across the grain into thin slices using a sharp knife. Explore some of the many wonders of over 70+ cuts of beef on the Canadian Beef Information Gateway.

Recipe Title: Italian Beef Stew (Spezzatino)
Recipe Summary: Slow cooked beef would always fill the kitchen with an aroma that would bring everyone to the table. When my mom was growing up, beef wasn’t plentiful in her small country town in Italy, so my grandmother would usually get less tender cuts that would create delicious stew-type meals like this one. Serve this saucy stew with plenty of crusty bread to soak up the sauce.

Sprinkle with flour, cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar and bay leaves; bring to boil, stirring and scraping up brown bits from bottom of pan.

Recipe Shopping List:
	- 1 lb (500 g) Extra Lean Ground Beef
	- Garlic
	- Green onions
	- Onion
	- 1 napa cabbage
	- Carrot
	- Gingerroot
	- Eggs
	- Soy sauce
	- Fish sauce
	- Sesame oil
	- Brown sugar
	- Cornstarch
	- Salt and pepper
	- 1 pkg wonton/dumpling wrappers
Recipe Methods:
	Filling:: 
		1. Cook ground beef, minced onion and 1 clove of garlic over medium-high heat in large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring often and using back of spoon to break up meat into small chunks, for 8 to 10 minutes or until beef is browned and thoroughly cooked. Remove from heat; drain off liquid, if necessary.
		2. Stir in remaining garlic, green onions, the finely chopped onion, napa cabbage, carrot, ginger, egg, soy sauce, fish sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, cornstarch, salt and pepper. Let cool to room temperature.
	Dumplings:: 
		3. Place 1 heaping teaspoonful (5 mL) of filling into the centre of a dumpling wrapper. Dip your finger into the beaten egg and wet the surrounding border of the dumpling wrapper. Carefully fold the dumpling into a half-moon shape and pinch the edges to seal both sides firmly together. Make sure that there are no gaps in the edges. Repeat the process until all the filling mixture is gone. This should make about 30 to 40 dumplings.
		4. Dumpling Dipping Sauce (if using): Combine sugar, soy sauce, vinegar and 1 tbsp (15 mL) water in a small bowl, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Set aside.
	To Steam:: 
		Heat 3 cups (750 mL) water in a shallow pan with; bring just to a boil. Reduce heat to keep water just simmering. Carefully arrange the dumplings onto a steamer basket and steam for 7 to 8 minutes or until dumplings are tender and filling is hot. Serve with Dumpling Dipping Sauce, if desired.
	To Pan-fry:: 
		Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil over medium-high heat in a medium nonstick skillet. Carefully place dumplings in the pan, spacing them apart, in batches as necessary. Fry until lightly browned on the bottom. Whisk 1 tsp (5 mL) cornstarch and ⅓ cup (75 mL) water in a small bowl to make a slurry; pour into pan. Cover, reduce heat to low and cook for 8 minutes or until filling is hot, dumplings are tender and the cornstarch slurry is transparent. Remove lid, increase heat to medium and boil until the remaining water has evaporated, leaving behind a crispy layer (‘skirt’) that holds the dumplings together. Remove from heat. Add an additional tablespoon (15 mL) of oil.
		To remove dumplings from pan, carefully invert a plate on top of the pan. Holding pan handle with one hand, place the other hand firmly on the plate, then gently flip both over to turn dumplings and crispy ‘skirt’ out onto plate. The dumplings are held together with the crispy ‘skirt’. *Important: serve the dumplings once all the water has evaporated to prevent the dumplings from sticking to the pan! * Repeat with remaining dumplings, adding more oil, water and cornstarch, as necessary. Serve with Dumpling Dipping Sauce, if desired.
	To Make Dumpling Soup (single serve): 
		Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil over medium heat in a saucepan. Add 3 cloves minced garlic and 2 tbsp (30 mL) thinly sliced onion; cook, stirring, for 3 minutes until fragrant. Add 1 cup (250 mL) beef broth and bring to a boil. Add 5 to 6 uncooked dumplings and boil for about 4 minutes or until the dumplings float. Gradually add 1 beaten egg to soup and carefully swirling it around. Garnish with 1 thinly sliced green onion.
Recipe Tips:
  - Tip: When wrapping the dumplings, you can replace the egg with 1 tbsp (15 mL) cornstarch mixed with 2 tbsp (30 mL) warm water.
  - Freezing DumplingsTo freeze dumplings, place the uncooked dumplings on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spacing them apart, and freeze until solid. Once frozen, you can package up the dumplings into a sealable freezer bag and store for up to 3 months. Steam from frozen for about 8 to 10 minutes; if pan-frying, increase cooking time on low to about 10 minutes, until filling is hot.

	- ½ cup (125 mL) EACH seasoned dry bread crumbs and grated Parmesan cheese (approx)
	- ½ cup (125 mL) prepared basil pesto
	- ½ tsp (2 mL) EACH salt and fresh ground pepper
	- 2 eggs, beaten
	- 1 lb (500 g) Extra Lean Ground Beef 
	- 12 oz (375 g) dry spaghetti
	- Chopped fresh parsley, optional
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 4 cups (1 L) prepared marinara sauce
	- seasoned dry bread crumbs
	- prepared basil pesto
	- salt and fresh ground pepper
	- 2 eggs
	- 1 lb (500 g)  Extra Lean Ground Beef 
	- dry spaghetti
	- fresh parsley
	- grated Parmesan cheese
Recipe Methods:
	1. Bring marinara sauce to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover and keep at a simmer. 
	2. Meanwhile, combine bread crumbs, ½ cup (125 mL) Parmesan, pesto, salt, pepper and eggs in a large bowl. Gently mix in ground beef with a fork (careful not to over-mix). 
	 3. Using a 1-oz (30 mL) scoop or two spoons, gently shape meat into about 24 meatballs and place on a baking sheet. 
	4. Carefully drop meatballs all at once into simmering sauce. Reduce heat to medium, cover and boil gently for 15 to 20 minutes or until a digital instant-read thermometer into several meatballs reads 160°F (71°C). Using a slotted spoon, transfer meatballs to a large bowl and cover and keep warm. 
	5. Meanwhile, cook spaghetti according to package directions; drain, reserving 1 cup (250 mL) cooking liquid. Return spaghetti to pot. Spoon three-quarters of the sauce over spaghetti and toss to coat. Add reserved cooking liquid, a splash at a time and tossing, until desired consistency is achieved. 
	6. Transfer pasta to a warmed large platter. Spoon remaining sauce and meatballs over top. Serve with additional Parmesan and garnish with parsley, if desired.
Recipe Tips:
  - Tossing the pasta with some cooking liquid ensures the sauce clings to the pasta nicely. Instead of serving with spaghetti, make hot sub sandwiches: spoon the meatballs and sauce over toasted sub-style buns, top with shredded mozzarella and broil just until the cheese melts.

Recipe Title: The 3 X 2 Smash Burger 
Recipe Summary: Canada Beef was a proud partner of Food & Drink’s 30th Anniversary Event where guests enjoyed this recipe, adapted from the original created by Christopher St. Onge for the Autumn 2023 issue of Food & Drink magazine. The best burger? Everyone has thoughts. Thick, thin, well-done, lots of toppings, barely any. What can’t be argued? That said, the smash burger is here to stay. As dangerously close (in the best way) to a salty meat pudding as any sandwich ought to be, a smash burger owes its ultra-beefy flavour to ground meat cooked over high heat in its own fat. Inspired by the Four Guys Burger at Gold Standard in Toronto and the Animal Style burger at California’s In-N-Out Burger, this three-patty, two-cheese babe is as local as your own kitchen. Marmite, an MSG-laden (again, in the best way!) yeast extract, is available at most large grocers. See Tip for customizing your burgers.

		- 2 very soft, small potato or brioche burger buns
		- 1 cup (250 mL) loosely packed shredded iceberg lettuce
		- 3 tbsp (45 mL) prepared yellow mustard, divided (approx)
		- 4 thin processed cheese slices
		- 1 dill pickle, sliced into ¼-inch (5 mm) thick coins
		- 2 slices bacon, cooked and halved crosswise (optional)
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 2 onions
	- 2 very soft, small potato or brioche burger buns
	- Iceberg lettuce
	- ¾ lb (375 g) Medium Ground Beef
	- Bacon (optional)
	- Canola or sunflower oil
	- Mayonnaise

	- Prepared yellow mustard
	- Sweet pickle relish
	- Dill pickle 
	- Marmite
	- Cayenne pepper
	- Salt
	- Pepper
	- Thin processed cheese slices
Recipe Methods:
	1. Burger Sauce: Combine mayonnaise, ketchup, relish, Marmite and cayenne in a small bowl, stirring well to dissolve Marmite. Cover and refrigerate until serving, for up to 1 week.
	2. Burgers: To caramelize onion, heat oil over medium heat in a 10- or 12-inch (25 or 30 cm) cast-iron skillet until shimmering. Add onions and ½ tsp (2 mL) salt. Spread out into an even layer and cook for about 3 minutes, until light golden. Stir and repeat process twice more. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 to 35 minutes or until deeply caramelized. 
	3. Meanwhile, divide ground beef into six equal portions. Working on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, pat each portion out into a large, flat patty 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter. Season generously with salt and pepper.
	4. Scrape onions into a heatproof bowl; set aside. Return skillet to heat; place buns cut side down in pan and toast for about 30 seconds or until golden at the edges. Transfer to plates. Clean pan.
	5. Divide Burger Sauce between top and bottom buns. Divide lettuce between bottoms. Set aside.
	6. Turn kitchen fan to HIGH. Set clean pan over high heat and heat until pan is smoking. 
	7. Add 3 patties to pan; press each lightly with a large offset spatula to make contact with pan. Cook for 1 minute, squirting a heaping teaspoonful (5 mL) of mustard onto uncooked side of each patty and spread to edges. Flip and immediately top two of the patties with a cheese slice and one-quarter of the onions. Cook for 45 seconds, until beef is thoroughly cooked, to 160°F (71°C). Stack the patties with the undressed one on top.
	8. Place stacked patties on bun bottom, top with half the pickle slices, half the bacon (if using) and sandwich with bun top. Serve immediately and repeat cooking process to make second burger.
Recipe Tips:
  - You can make and stack as many patties as you like, even change the ration of meat to cheese (for instance, a double burger with 2 cheese slices) or leave the cheese out altogether. Each patty requires 2 oz (60 g) ground beef; if you don’t have a scale, visit a meat counter where you can ask for a very specific weight of beef, then divide by eye at home.

Recipe Title: Persian Okra Stew (Khoresh Bamieh)
Recipe Summary: By Tara Omidvar, @madeofsugarandsaffron, Khoresh Bamieh or okra stew is a dish originating in the south of Iran. It’s a hot and flavourful dish with lots of garlic. Okra, beef and tamarind are the main ingredients. Like many other Iranian stews, there are different versions of this stew as well. Some cooks add split peas and some make it without tamarind. This version is the one that Tara’s grandmother taught her. The sourness that tamarind provides to this dish can’t be replaced with any other ingredient. As with every other Iranian stew, this dish is always served with saffron rice. You can also serve Shirazi Salad (see Tip), fresh herbs and/or pickled vegetables as accompaniments.

	- 1 large onion, finely chopped
	- 8 cloves garlic, minced
	- 1 tsp (5 mL) ground turmeric
	- ½ tsp (2 mL) hot pepper flakes
	- 1 tbsp (15 mL) tomato paste
	- Shirazi Salad (optional, see Tip)
	- Chopped green onions, fresh mint and/or cilantro (optional)
Recipe Shopping List:
	- 11 oz (310 g) tamarind paste 
	- 1 lb (500 g) Beef Boneless Blade Steak or Roast or Stew Cubes
	- Salt and fresh ground pepper
	- Olive oil
	- 1 lb (500 g) okra
	- 1 large onion
	- 8 cloves garlic
	- Ground turmeric
	- Hot pepper flakes
	- 1 can tomato paste
Recipe Methods:
	1. Combine tamarind paste with boiling water in a heatproof bowl. Let stand for about 30 minutes or until softened.
	2. Meanwhile, pat beef dry with paper towel. Season all over with salt and pepper to your taste. Set aside.
	3. Heat half of the oil over medium heat in a large heavy Dutch oven or enamelled cast-iron roaster. Cook okra, stirring, for about 5 minutes or until slightly tender. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
	4. Add remaining oil to pot. Cook onion over medium heat, stirring, for about 5 minutes or until golden. Add garlic and turmeric; cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Add beef, in batches to avoid overcrowding pot, and cook, turning, until browned on all sides. Transfer to a bowl as each batch is browned.
	5. Return beef and accumulated juices to pot. Add hot pepper flakes and tomato paste; cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add 4 cups (1 L) water or enough to cover the meat. Bring to a boil, stirring and scraping up brown bits from bottom of pot.
	6. Cover, reduce heat and simmer for 1 to 1½ hours or until meat is fork-tender, stirring occasionally and adding more water as needed to keep moist.
	7. Meanwhile, use a&nbsp;fork to separate tamarind paste from the seeds and extract juice. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing the pulp to squeeze out liquid; discard solids. Set thin paste aside.
	8. Stir strained tamarind juice and sautéed okra into pot. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes or just until flavours are blended (be careful don’t overcook the okra or it will become mushy). Season with salt and pepper to taste.
	9. Serve stew garnished green onions, mint and/or cilantro and with Shirazi Salad on the side, as desired.
Recipe Tips:
  - *The tamarind paste called for in this recipe is the type that comes in a block and contains seeds and strings. If your tamarind paste has no seeds and string, or if using a tamarind sauce in a jar, skip steps 1 and 6 and add the tamarind to the stew directly along with sautéed okra, adding enough boiling water to keep the stew moist. Keep in mind that you might need to adjust the quantity of tamarind to suit your taste. To make Shirazi Salad: Combine 1 cup (250 mL) diced cucumber, ⅔ cup (150 mL) diced tomato, ⅓ cup (75 mL) diced red onion, 1 tbsp (15 mL) fresh lemon juice and 1 tsp (5 mL) dried mint (or 1 tbsp/15 mL minced fresh mint) in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
